clearly necessary to adopt the conjecture which, in har·
mony with general Terentian usage, will best satisfy all
requirements. 10 this connection I have studied oarefully
the numerous contributione 10 Το0001100 literature pub

The introduction 10 somewhat longer than originally
planned. The Andria, however, is often the first Latin
play read by studento, and it seemed desirable to give
them the proper historical perspective 100 the interesting
literary and linguistic problems 01 Latin eomedy.

I beg to aoknowledge the kindly interest shown in this
work by my former teacher, Professor Minton Warren 01 ’
Harvard University, undoubtedly the best Terentian scholar
in Amerioa..1 am also deeply indebted to the general
editors, Professors Ο. Ε. Bennett and J. Ο. Rolfe, 001 only

100 their oareful reading of the proci-sheeta, but also 100
many suggestions and 0000010103Ι criticisms, of which I have
taken 1011 advantage. To my friend and colleague, Pro-
fessor E. M. Pease,1 am grateful 100 00 little advice and
assistance. Το him is due the diagram which 1 have in-

serted 00 p. 156, and in many other ways his knowledge 01

1110 Μο0. has been 01 1110 greatest service to me.
