part in Plautus and Terence, and many of the variatione
from classical prosody, found in these writers, are due to the
influence of accent, as contrasted with quantity.

⁵2. Moreover, word-nocent and verse-acoent, erictus (beat),
largely coincide in Plautus and Terence, aud seldom olash,
as in Vergil, in the important words of a verse. Thus we
never find in Terence an ictus like sequimur or pectora or
indictum. Indeed, the rnetrical ictnses of lines in comedy
coincide pretty closely with the ordinary accentuation of
words in everyday speech. Many words, we must remem-
ber, are long enough to admit two accents,¹ eg. decreveram,
econimcltus, ete. Further, the accent of a word in a sentence
may be different from that which it bears when standing
by itself. Thus the subordinate words in a sentence may
unite with the ruore important ones to form word-groups,
which then follow the ordinary rules of accentuation,
eg. polizlspuom (21), adesdum (29), optol-me (36). Among
such subordinate words² are: (1) enclitic particles,
as prce, -oe, enlm, etc, eg. imino enim (823); (2) the forms
of the verb esse; (3) the indefinite and relative pronouns,
together with the possessive, personal, demonstrative, and
reflexive pronouns, when unemphatic, eg. quoe cese (792),
hudo quoae (794), noscdnt srva (23), crore-m suo (177), ediec
tior· (204), coe misero inihi (302), inter se (220), Attic(am)
ess(e) hanc (221); (4) auxiliary verbs, eg. missdsfaoe (833);
(5) unemphatic nouus, eg homia(i) ddulesceatulo (828);
(6) prepositions and conjunctione, eg. in tempore (819),
u roceam (vn).

53. In words of four syllables, having the first three
short (υ υ υ κ), the verse ictus falls upon the first sylla
ble in Plautus and (with exceptions) in Terence, e.g.

¹ facilius, rndllooli (16), relicuom (25), Glycerium, mellocia

¹ A primary and a secondary.
