ΑΡΡΕΝΙΠΧ. 177

921. seraa: ihus A, followedby Da and now Flech Other Mes.
and editors give seres.

922. dico . . . audierim: A, followed generally. Spem follows the
other Mes. in giving dixi and audieris (also A as corrected).

928. Cn. Nomen torn cito? ΡΛ. Phanio. Si. Hem? Pe. Perii!
With the readIng adopted ln the text, contrast the one generally
accepted: Ca. Nomen tom ciro tibi? Pr. Hem, perii. (So Umpf
lilote, Dz. spen.) The explanation given is thet Crito la supposed to
hesitate, and Pamphilus, afraid that he has forgotten the name, thinks
that this means ruiu for himself. But even Pamphilus does not know
how much significance lies in the name, aud therefore is not likely to
cry out perii because of a slight forgetfulness on Crito'e part. We
may well believe, too, that Pamphilus himself could easily supply the
name, if lt were essential, for he must often have heard it from

- Glycerium.

Now Don. and all the Mes. (incl. A) have Phanio aiter Crito'e
question, and two ol Bentley'e codices omit tibi, while a third has lt
by second hand, where something (possibly Pom.) has been erased.
A assigna hem perii to Crito, but, aa corrected, to Simo. The rest
give nem perii to Chremes, and so Bene Meis. and now Fleck. Such
an arrangement occurred, it is true, to Donatus, who aska: An
Chremis eei dolentia cel cd eins mentionem rel qnod in ‚liliam poene
peccarat i But this is improbable, for the next utterances of Chremes
are those of joy ι cl. 930-931.

'ibe clew to the proper explanation of the passage is found in Don,
who says: Pitonia .· Hoc ito dicit Crito, at nemo crrcliret, scilicet odire
dubitans, an ipse eit,· and again: Hem: santoni peram Simonem
dicere, irascentem filio, Critonem submonenti. As Bent„ points out,
if no one could hear what Crito said, the hem perii would be absurd.
But if, as the next note suggests, Pamphilus prompted Crito, we can
see why Simo should turn angrily upon his son, and why then Pam-
philus, covered with confusion, should cry perii, on which word Don.
remarks: Hoc Pamphilus poet iracundiam petris. Note that it ia
Pamphilus who, in his impatience, again jogs Crito's memory ln 943.

930. oiebai : both aiebam and cibam were used by Terence z cf. 932.
See Engelbrecht, Studia Terens, p. 67. Fleck. here reads cibat.

931. audiuere: Mes. show tum before the verb (audiere D G V),
but Beni. reiected it on the evidence ol his Peterhouse Codex. Fleck.
now returns to tam, reading andire.

9³4. qni td credie: so Fleck. for qui credis. Α has quid credis.

936, poste: this is F. Skutsch’s conjecture for postilla (Mas.) in
N .
