asked to put en iniant (represented in the ancient illustratione as
naked) on the bare ground. ara: ie. the altar of Apollo, which in
other comedies (cf. Plaut. Mero. 675) ismentioned as standing before
the house. Apollo was the god of ways end streete (Ἆγυιεύς).
umbones: the word is used in Latin with both a general and a
special application. lt is given by Verg. decre. 2. 131, in a list of

Menander spoke of the myrtle here. nbi: dative of advantage with

The lull expression would be, et itu ego agorn, ut liquido possim iurare.

his door. intenderam: the metaphor, according to Donatus, is
from spreading nete in hunting. Davus, then, meant to decoy Simo
end Chremes.
