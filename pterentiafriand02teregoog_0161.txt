Peon 3] PROLOGUE.

16. contaminari: mixed, tf. Heont. prol. 16-192-

Nam quod rumores dintulerunt malivoli

, 'Multis contaminisse Graecas, diirn fecit
Paucis Latinas: facturn hic esse id non negat
Neque se pigere et deinde facturum autumet

The word means literally briny inpellier, mix, but minino is often
synonymcus with spelling, pollutiny, and this is the usual significa-
tion of the word. ln Terence, the word involves a double meaning,
for, as used by his critics, it obviously implies polline, but since
Terence would hardly admit the charge thet he spoiled many Greek
plays (Hectit. 17), itis clear that he accepts the word in its neutral
sense. So contopirnn and corttopio are used by Lucretius (3. 345, 740)
and Cicero (de Fato, 3. 5, etc.) in the neutral sense. Λ cornedy that
was turned into Latin without admixture with another was called ·
integro (Heont. 4), the opposite, therefore, of contaminato.

17. faclnntne . . . intellegent: ie not tlte net result-os their
knoteinpnese this, thot they know nolitne? A good instance of oxy·
moron. -oe often in Plautus end Terence for nonne; cf. the frequent
estne hio, es in 801. Α. d G. 210. d; B. 102. 2. c; G. 454. note 5.
nibli: the forms nihil and nil are interchangeable. There was a
constent tendency to drop initial or medial n, which had little pho-
netic value; cf. prendo, ueniens. 111 Plautus, nihil is always e
monosyllable.

18. accusant: for the indicative, cf. B. 200.1; G. 582, Nae·
ulum, etc: see Introd. ἐξ 27-20.

19. hic noster 2 this poet os oure, the writer kecping up the method
oi speaking of himself in the third person: cf. Hor. Sat. 2. 0. 411111-
fectiorin diem ethoram incidiae noster. auctores ε· puides, molleis.
These writers, especially Plautus, took many liberties with their origi-
nels. Hence, perhaps, Horace's criticism of Plautus, securus cudat cn
recto nelsobulo talo (Epist. 2. 1. 176).

20. neclegentiam: enreless sreedorn ; necl— is the correct spelling
for Terence. The authors named may or may not have prsctised
contaminatio, but they tlid show much freedom in dealing with their
originale. Terence claims that bis own practice of contaminatio,
which is so severely denounced by the critice, is but in accord with
this freedom.

21. obscurem diligentiam: unintelligible cccrirooy. By dili·
pentio is meant such an extremo precision in reproducing thc original,
in its form, manner, and composition, es to forbid originality andland
