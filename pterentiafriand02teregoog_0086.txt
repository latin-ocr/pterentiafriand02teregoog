noticed in Terence should doubtless he mentioned as charae·
teristic of colloquial Latin3 but for an author ae early ae
Terence itis often hard to draw the line between what is
colloquial and what is merely archaic. Early forms and
expressions are often preserved in later literature only in
colloquial style,-a fact which ie well illustrated in the
Epietlee of Cicero and his correspondents.

Where, however, we find alternative forms in Terence,
those which are generally used are, no doubt, the familiar
lorms of conversation, while the others, being less colloquial,
are employed only for metrical reasons. In Cicero's epraeter,
for example, the syncopated forms of tenses in the perfect
system of verbs are far more frequent than in more formal
Latin. Similarly, verbal substantives in -tio, nomina cycnus
in -tor and tria (ef. 232), and adjectivee in arluc (cf. iocre·
larius, 782) are characteristic of colloquial diction. So, too,
in syntax, the use of the indicative in subordinate clauses
in indireet discourse and in deliberative questione ie found
in the epistolary style, as is also the second person oi the
imperative subjunctive in positive commende. The pro·
nominal subject of an infinitiva is often omitted in Cicero's
Epietlee.

(10) The use of hic forepn asin 310, is similar to Horace's
colloquial employrnent of noster in the Satires (2. 6. 48).
Other expressions which we may regard aa distinctly collo·
quial are such verbal periphrases as miserem sace (680, 833)
and effectum reddam (703, 864), the form emeram ior
arcessere; the use of the affirmative particle ore (245), for
which we may compare Horace, Set. 1. 10. 213 and the fre·
quent use of audin (299), enlin (749), ain (8753 cf. cie. ad
Fam. 9. 21), and other forms compouuded with the inter·
rogative particle ore.

(11) Playing upon words is a colloquial feature sparingly
used by Terence, as in amentium laced curantium (218), et.
42, 338.
