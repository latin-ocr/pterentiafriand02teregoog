arrasam. 161

aduoricndo iniuriosi, and si derieyet reproducing si nolit. Editors

generally punctuate with a inll stop or a colon after molit ducere.
156. animam advertendo: in view oi the Mes. inconsistencies and

uncertainties in tho spelling oi nortere (uertere) and derivatives in

Terence, lt seems well to adhere throughout to the older iorm nora.

See the Hauler-Dziatzko Phormio, p. 583 Lindsay, Lat. Leno, p. 467.
167. See App. 154. An easy emendation would be,—

Qui mi exorandnst ; et ego spero confore

171. sequor: ii, as seems probahle, Simo remains on the stage,
sequar is better than sequor. The latter is used in Buri. 998, i proc,
sequor, hut there the speaker iollows immediately, G and 0 give sequar.

173. modo: it is not necessary ior Simo to go within aiter the
first scene to inform the household, ior his words in 47 imply that thie
had been done before, and lines 159 n. show that Davus had already

excited his master’s suspicions. Modo then refers back to a moment
just before the opening, not oi sc. 2, but oi sc. l. So Don. and Bent.

175. semper lenitas: several editors (including Klotz, Wag. Meis.)
take semper in an attributiva sense with lenitas, but such a nse, rare
at all times, is quite uncertain for Terence. The nearest parallel is
Heooi. ai, Quamquam liaeo inter noa anper notitia admodnmsi, where,
however, est is equivalent to facta est. The case is different with
(ag.) circum itione, 202, where the noun has a strong verhal force.

181. internae-itantia: Conradt's conjecture, accepted by Dz. and

. Fleck., is supported by a lemma in M (Schlee, pp. 17, 34).

184. For hem Fleck. now reads em, which is certainly less appro-
priate here. The difference between the two interjectione is well put
hy Kohler, in Wdlfflin’s Archiv, vol. VI (1889), Die Portikel en (ent),
thus: em accompanies the action, hem accompanies the succeeding
impression. Α good illustra-tion is Ad. 559: lla. Hem, qnid nomas?
Sv. Em, uide nt discidit labrum. So here hem implies that the speaker
has just noticed Simo. Em is originally the accusative oi n demon-
strative pronoun. (For another derivation, see Lindsay, Lot. Luam,
p. 611.) The Mss. here show no disagrecment, but Kohler (iootnote,
p. 29) points ont that P Cl with Α are very trustworthy in preserving
the distinction between hem and em.

189. olidm . . . cilios: on the change oi ictus, ci. hocine‘at . . .
hiemari, 236; iton . . . ituria, 492 ; ipso. . . marim, 532; Drdnm
. . . Dromo,85ll; uirum. . . mereim, 958.

190. dehinc, in ordinary temporal sense, not ‘hence’ ‘accord-
ingly‚' as given in Lewis’ Latin Lexicon.
