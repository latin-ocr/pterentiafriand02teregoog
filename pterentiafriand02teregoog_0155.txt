which, irum being applied to the Greek dramatie poets who taupltt the
actors their parts, carne to denote the general work ot preparing ior ·
the publio performance of a piece. Didascaliae were regularly pre·
pared by Roman gramruariaus, such as the famous M. Terentius Varro
(llo-27 aa), who wrote much about the stage. 1t isnot probabis that
