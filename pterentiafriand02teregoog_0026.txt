Philemon,¹ probably because the* latter was a more forcible,

though less refined, writer. Plautus, we know, preferred '
Philemon as a model, while the more fastidious Terence
took most of his plays from Menander.²

It is unfortunate that we do not possess a complete comedy
of Menander’s, and cannot study at first hand his skill in
the construction of a plot. But that he considered this of Ι
prime importance we may gather froin the plays of his
imitator Terence. A story, too, is recorded that on one
occasion he said a certain play was almost ready, inasmuch
as he had finished the plot and had nothing to do but write
the verses. Moreover, Menander had the greatest reverenoe
for Euripides, who, in comparison with the other famous
tragedians of Greece, shows perhaps the greatest technical
skill in the weaving and unravelling of plots. The plots of
Euripides abeund in surprises aud complications; and if
these are characteristic of the Terentian plays, itis chiefly
due to the fact that Menander and the other writers of New
Comedy had studied in the school ol Euripides. How much
these drarnatists admired his art is well illustrated by one
of Philemon's characters who says that he would gladly
take his own life, if he were sure that by so doing he would
be brought face to lace in the other world with Euripides.³

In Merrander's hands, comedy reflecte the amusing side of
everyday life. In his age the moral tone of Athens was
low, and it is not surprising, therefore, that the nrilr'eu ofa
