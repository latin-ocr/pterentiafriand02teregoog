202. circum itione: this reading oi Bentley's is confirmed hyR
(16 Α XII), “as iar as I know the only Me. which oilers timum
itione” (Warren, in Amor. Jonr. os Part, vol. Ill, p. 61). Itis
given, however, in the Glossarium Terentianum, 106 (Goetz), and M
has circummitione (Schlee).

usus es: Don. mentions a variant neor es, on which see scholi
(walfflin’s Arellio, vol. 11, p. 210).

203. Spengel is incorrect in making facilius the normal pronuncia-
tion lor Terence. See Lindsay in Philologus, vol. LI, pp. 364 it.

205. neque tn 60601) .· the authority oi Don. must be regarded as
more weighty than that oi the Mss. The latter (Bent’s R-lt Α
XII— shows houd as a correction ior hoc) have neque tu hoc, but Don.
hesitanti, thus yielding ior Terence an illustration oi the negative pleo-
nasm, so common in Plautus See Brix on Men. 311, neque id haud
inmerito tuo, where, as here, there are three negativos altogether.
The explanation oi Don, that the three negativos are equivalent to
one, is oi course incorrect, but indicating as 16 does (ii the reading oi
Don. is correct), that the usage was not understood in his day, is an
additional argument against ltoc. As is the case here, Plautus always
has a pronoun between neque and haud.

On tlre spelling nnis before consonante (adopted by Fleck), see

Orlyin os Latin natta atad Grecis oi, in Ainer. Jour. os Pau, vol
XVIII (1807), pp. 43 if. According to Horten-Smlth, ltnnd and ot are

analogy with sed, aided perhaps by extenslon oi the ablatiral d.

210. opitulor .· Lindsay in Philologus, vol. LI, pp. 364 ff, islnclined
to regard this ae a case oi “ later treatment ’' to avoid the archaia -06

inserting irinc with Beni. Without ltine, a spondaic word, olim,
would iill the fourth ioot in asenarius. (See Draheim in Hermes,
vol. XV, p. 230.) Moreover, to prove that the girl was a ciuis Attica,
16 is necessary to state that the narrantur came irom Athens.
