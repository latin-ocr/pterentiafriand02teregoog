why Terence introduced Charinus was the fear that it would
be too harsh¹ to leave Philumena without a husband
More probably, Terence merely wished to increase the com-

plexity of the plot. It is to be observed that he did not
introduce Philumena herself, as a modern dramatist would
certainly have done.

³6. As for contaminatio in the Andria, this is practically
confined to the first scene of the play. The Epicurean sen·
timent found in 959 ff. was taken, we are told, from Menan·
der's Errnrvcli ,· but the only complete scene which we know
to he due to contaminatio is the opening one. This comes
from Menander's Perinthia, which in the first scene closely
resembled Menander’s Andria. The latter, however, opencd

the old man and his wife. For the wife Terence substituted
the freedman Sosia, perhaps because to the Romans it would

, have seemed less natural to discuss with a matron a young

man’s amour. Sosia, it will be noticed, never appears again,
being merely what the Greeks called a πρόσωπον speraram,
or introductory character, like Philotis and Syra in the
Hecyra, and Davus iu the Phormio, and brought in mainly
to give clearness and variety to the opening narrative.

³⁷. Roman comedies were sometimes classified, according
to the degree of vivacity which distinguished them, into
motoriae, statariae, and mimae.² The motoriac were full of
movement, the stata-riae were quiet in tone, and the mimae
partook of both these features. The plays of Plautus are
for the most part arietariae ; those of Terence, vrristae.⁸

The Andria represents Terence’s normal style, and is a
sabata mista. Only in two or three scenes is there much
lively antion; ey. Act I, Scene 5, where Pamphilus is in
