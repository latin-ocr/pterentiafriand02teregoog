great distress of mind3 Act ΙΙ, Scene 2, where Davus rushes
in with the news that no wedding is contemplated; and
especially Act IV, Scene 4, where Davus nearly drives
Mysis into a state ot fronzy. The dialogne, however, is
always tersa and animated, the narrative at times very pic·
turesque, and the situations exhibit much sentimental pathos.
Simo’s story in the first scene is praised by Cicero¹ asa
descriptiva masterpiece. Other passages of singular vivid-

and Davus' recital of his observations at Clrremes' house
(353ff.). For excellent specimens of refined and sprightly
dialogus, see Act 11, Scene 6; Act Ill, Scene 33 and Act V,
Scene 3.

Simo, however, is moreat fanlt than theson. He takes
uo steps to protect Pamphilus from the tcmptations to
which he is exposed, bnt is content to let lrim “have his
fling,” believing that, in accordance with his general char-
