Hecyra, we learn that the duty was assigned to an old man, probably
ln both cases Ambivius Turpio.

Since the Andria was the first play which Terence exhibited, aud
since this prologue implies a knowledge oi the play ou the part oi the
critic, it iollows either that this prologus was not written tor the first
periormance, or that the iratas poeta (line i) had some means oi be
coming acquainted with the play before its public presentatiou lt
is possible, oi course, that the critic derived his knowledge irorn the
recitatiou before Caecllius (see Introd. ξ 31), or from the preliminary
rehearsal before the curule aediles ; but Karsten (in his article Teren·
tiani Iholnyi ¹) gives several reasons ior believing that the Andria
originally had no prologue, and that the extant one belongs to a aecond
periorinanee. Lines l-i, 24-28, could hardly have been written by a
hitherto unknown playwright, unless we are prepared to admit that
the young and inodest Terence could speak with surprising confidence
oi his own iuture work, as well as with unbecoming irony (line li) oi
an older ailil well-known poet. The uetus poeta knew the Andria,
