aa The Andria, or Μαῖα os Andros, takes its name from
110 heroine Glycerium, who has had 0 peculiar history.

She was born in Athens, bnt 10 101 infanoy her father
Chremes, when about to take a journey into Asia, had left
her in charge 01 101 00010 Phania Some time later, desir-
iug to escape 11010 warfare, Phania set out with his niece
to jein the absent Chremes. Their ship was wreclred 011
Andros, but Phania and Pasibula, as she was then called,
being rescued, were hospitably received by a citizen 01 110
island, who, on Phania’s death, which occurred shortly
afterward, adopted the child, changed her name to Gly-
cerium, and brought her up with his own daughter Chrysis.
On her father's death, Chrysis went 10 Athens, accom-
panied by her reputed sister, now a very beautiful young
woman.

In Athens, at the house 01 Chrysis, Pamphilus, son 01
Simo, fell desperately in love with Glycerium. Airaid 10
ask his father's consent, he could not marry her, though he
treated 10100 110 wife. In 1110 attitude toward 10110 was
confirmed, when not long afterward Chrysis, on her death·
bed, solemnly commended Glycerium 10 110 care.

But the course 01 love was 00110 100 0100011. Chremes

· had 00000οἀ daughter, named Philumena, born since the
disappearance 01 Pasibula, and as he was anxious 10 000
101 well settled in life, he arranged with Simo a marriage
between 110 daughter and Pamphilus, 01 whom he had

, heard nothing but good reporta.

A touching scene at the funeral 01 Chrysis revealed to
Simo and the 100101 110 world Pamphilus' affection 101
