by the originale, admitted of considerable freedom both iu
verbal rendering¹ and in plotconstruction. In the develop
ment of Roman comedy, the tendency since the days of
Naevius and Plautus had been in tho direction of a closer
imitation of the Greek originale. In the school of Lanuvinus,
this tendency seems to hare reached the extreme antithesis
to the freedom iu which Plautus indulged. Lanuvinus, we
ars told,² adhered so literally to his originals that he made
poor Latin plays out of good Greek oues, aud this obscuro
diliyentr'a (Andr. prol. 2ll—extrerne precision with resulting
obscurity—is seizerl upon by Terence as the main charac-
teristic of his opponent’s school. To those who held with
Lanuvinus that a Greek original should be reproduoed in
its integrity, without alterations, the practice adopted hy
Terence, even in his earliest conredy, of corubiuiug soenes
from different originals, was naturally very ostensiva-con·
terninano they called it in derision. Terence, however, justi-
fies the practice on the ground that it harrnonizes with the
freedorn indulged iu by his famous predecessors⁸ Doubt·

the parallel passages in Terence shows nrauy differences in the presan·

The view that the “poetical canon’' of Lanuvinus “ was a close imi-
tation ol the earlier Latin comedians” will uot hear examination.

Naevius aud Plautus employed contaminatio in the specillo sense in
which the word is used iu Terence, cl. Ghtz, Acen Soc. Lr'pa 6. 310,
