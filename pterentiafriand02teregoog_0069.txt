Since the time of Bentley, it has been customary for
editors to assist the reader by marking the ictus, but only
in the alternate ieet in those metros which the Greeks
measured by dipodies. In the line just quoted, there are
really six ictuses, three of which are not marked, viz, on
the syllables quom, aot, and lit}

1. Insteio.

64. For the iambus, υ L, any of the following feet may be
substituted: (a) tribrach‚ υ (κ υ; (b) spondee, > L3 (c) ana·
pacet, wL5 (d) dactyl, > <a υ ; (e) proceleusmatic, w 6 υ.
In an acatalectic verse, however, the final foot must bo a
pure iambus, or pyrrhic (υ υ), the last syllable, of course,
being indifferent (syllaba anceps).

’ 6⁵. lambio senarius (Trimeter acatalectic).—This is the

commonest metro in Terence. All the plays open with it,
and in the Andria it is used in over five hundred verses.
The verse admits caesura, usually the penthemimeral, before
,the long syllable or its equivalent in the third f00t3 less
commonly the hepthemimeral, in a similar position iu the
fourth foot. The letter caesura is often accompenied bya
diaeresis afterthe second foot, or a secondary caesura in that
foot. Many verses, however, have no well-defined caesura.

An anapaest does not immediately follow a dactyl. In
the proceleusmatic, which occurs most commonly in the
first foot, and perhaps never in the fifth, the third syllable,
bearing the ictus, must begin a word3 ci. 164. Lines
162-166 are scanned as follows:-

Facturum magis id adeo mihi ut incommodet
Quam ut obsequaturgnato. Quapropter? Rogas?

¹01. Horace, Ara Poet. 252 : -

trimetris accrescere iussit
nomen iambeis, cum senos redderet ictus
pimus ad extremum similis sibi.
