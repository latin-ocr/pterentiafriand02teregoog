⁷1. Cleusulee. -Interspersed among the longer verses in
alyrio passage, and at the end of a series of similar verses
in ordinary dialogus, we sometimes find much shorter lines,
known as clausulae, which continue the rhythm of tho pre·
ceding verses, and are subject to the same metrieal rules.
The only metros used in the Andria in these clausulae are
the lambio quetemerius (Dimeter Aortssectic), as in 176, 240,
244, 252, 485 (catalectic), 537, 605, 635-638 (638b catalectio),
and trocheis quetemerius (Dimeter Cotelectlc) as in 246 and
517.

⁷2. Examples of these vnetres are found only in the
Artoria. In 626-634, wo have nine cretio tetrameters. The

feet a long syllable sometimes takes the place of the short

Four bacchiac tetrameter acatalectic verses are found in
Andr. 481-484. Either or both of the two long syllables in
the bacchica, o Α, may be resolved into two shorts, except
at the end cf the line or before the principal break. In the
first and third feet, a long syllable may be substituted for
the short.

A single dactylis tetrameter occurs in Terence, via: in
Andr. 6252- ’

73. In one respect a Latin cornedy resembled a modern
opera. Λ large proportion of each play was either sung, or
reciterl toa musical accompaniment. Scenes which were
merely spoken and involved no musical clement were
known as diverbia. These were the soenes oomposed in
iambic senarii, crnhracing about one-half of each Terentian
play. Terence, as we have seen, begins all his plays with
senarii, plain speech without music being appropriate to the
