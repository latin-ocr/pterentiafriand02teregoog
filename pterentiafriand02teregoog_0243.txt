appended the name of a certain Calliopins. Who Calliopius was, and
when he lived, are vexed questions; but it ie now agreed that all our
Mes. except A are descended from a common ancestor, which gave
the text of Terence, as revIsed by Calliopius.

. It is commonly believed that the Mss. of the γ group are the purest
representativee of the Calliopian renensium while those of the t family,
though betrayIng the hand of Calliopins, are descended from a Me.
prepared with the additional help of the commentarIes of Donatus,
Servius, and Priscian. Aelius Donatus, whose valuable commentary
on Terence ls extant, lived ln the middle of the fourth century. Servius,
who is best known to us as a commentator on Vergil, belongs ιο the
end of the same century3 aud Priscian, the great grammarian, fleur-
iahed lu the beginning of the sixth century. 'l'he grammarian Ilugra·
phius, whose commentary on Terence is still extant, was, it would
seem, a younger contemporary of Priscian It is probable that Callio-
pius was earlier thau any of the commentatore just mentioned. Leol
places him iu the third century, and Konrad Braun² in the end of the
third or the beginning of the fourth. Dalatzk0‚⁸ Schlee, and others,
however, assign him ιο the fifth century, and therefore suppose him ιο
be later than Donatus.

Scholars have generally assumed that the t gronp possesses a de-
cided superiority over the γ family. Indeed, Spengel is the only
editor of Terence who consistently gives the preference to P. The
traditional and generally accepted view was ably combated by Pro·
fessor Pease, in a paper On tte Relatice Volua of tlte Mes. os Terence,
publlshed in the Transactions cs the American Philoloyicnl Aesonia·
tlon for 1887, vol. XVIII. Basing his arguments ou the apparatus
ονίιίοοε furnished by Umpfenbach, Professor Pease proved, by care·
fully comparing the Mss. and counting the varlauts, that the impor-
tauce of the γ family had been seriously nnderrated, thath more often
agrees with it thau with the t family, and that far fewer errors had
crept into the archetype of the former than into that of the latter.

Even those editors who believe that more walght should be given
ιο the t than to the γ family do not lire up to their theory. In my
paper on The Text os the Andria os Terence⁴ 1 have proved, 1 belleve,
that not only Spengel, but also Dziatzko and Fleckeisen actually accept
