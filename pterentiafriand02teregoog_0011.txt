1. Before Greek civilitation, with its wonderful literature,
became known to the Romans, this people can hardly be
said to have had any literature of its own. History, it is
true, was represented by bald chronicles, oratory foundanurs
ery in the courts and in political contests, and even verse was
composed for religious ceremonial, as well as for ieasts and
funerals3 but such scanty specimens as survive from early
times fully support the view that the first impulse toward
genuine literature in Rome came from contact with Greece.l

a But it must not be supposed that the Romans had no
natura] and original gift for literary creation. No nation
could have produced such splendid results through mere
imitation. Probably it is in the field of prose that the
unaided Roman genius would have shown the best fruits of
its development, for the Roman character was essentially
practical and unimaginative. Even without Greek guid·
auce, substantial results would undoubtedly have been
achieved in the literary spheres of jurisprudence, oratory,
history, and didactie waiting.

3. Of poetical forms, the drama seems to have harmonized
best with the Roman character, and we find ample evidence
that the necessary elementa existed from which an Italian
literary drama-not perhaps of a high type-might have
been evolved without the aid of foreign influence.
