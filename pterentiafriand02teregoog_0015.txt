THE DEVELOPMRNT OF ROMAN COMEDY. ix

stage Etruscan dancers performed in pantomimo to the music
of the flute. According to Livy (l'. 2), the Roman youth
improved upon these performances by indulging in respon·
sive and jocular verses. In other words, they combined the
danae and music with the Fescennino verses. This combi-
nation was known as satura, a word which has given rise to
much discussion, but which is probably best explained by
the analogous expressions lanc ialam and lec sucro. As
lona aarum means a dish filled with various kinds of fruit
offered to the gods, and lec sctum was a law which included

saturo (sc. subula) was properly a medley or miscellany, and r
referred to the⁴ varied character ol the performance. After

the establishment of regular plays, the dramatic saturae con·
tinued to be employed as farces or after-plays (exodia). The

later Roman satire, the distinguishing feature oi which is its
censorious spirit, is fathered upon Lucilius(180-103 s.c.); but
even in Horace we find traces of the miscellaneous character
of the early saturo, and J uvenal’s phrase, ceslii surrupo libelli
(1. 86), descriptive of his satire, seems to be a direct refer·

Latin in origin, are yet independent of the regular Greek
drama, were the popular Mime and Atellau farae. The
illinus, called in pure Latin planipedio,² was introduced into
Rome from the Greek colonies in Italy. It was a broad
farcicsl and mimia representation of low life, and though
performed independently of other plays at the Floralia, it

describing saturo, Livy (7. 2) merely assumes an early Roman parallel
