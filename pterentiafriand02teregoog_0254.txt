166 APPIINDIX.

taking itis moribus us equivalent ιο lu‘s mombus praedito (so Don.) and
comparing oum erroribus notis commissiones, LIv. 10. 22. 3.

398. οιια.· Don. read aliam, aud so Bentley (whose English Mes.
however had alia), followed by Umpf. and Dz., but alia seems decid-
edly preferable.

408. apud te ut sies, Mes, but ut ts rightly omitted by Flecln iu
accordanoe with Don. end Glossarium Terentianum, 29 (Goetz, p. iv).

414. bunc: so Mss. Bent. pronounced this ¹line spurious on the
ground that bunc refers ιο Pamphilus, who, however, hes not leit the
stege siuce his colloquy with Charinus. But bunc must refer to Simo.

⁴ Following Bentley's suggestion, Flecln gives ius for hunc, but the
oontrust which ipsum (415) implies is in favor of tunc.

434. nequeo quicquam nunc quidem: so Fleck„ who in substitut-
lng nequeo for oeque (lllss.) follows the plausible conjecture oi Von
Winterfeld (Hennes, vol. XXXIII, p. 168). The words aeque quis
quam nunc quidem which spen. and Dz. give as a question to Simo
cannot be explained satisfactorily ; quicquam demands a negative.

439. niem propter consuetudinem huiusce hospitae: the Mes. have
propter huiusce hospitae consuetudinem. Most editors follow the con·
jecture of Erasmus, huiusce propter consuetudinem hospitae, thch
violatos the rule that ln Plautus and Terence the forms of hic in -e and
-ce occur only before vowels aud h. Spengel conjectures propter (ne)
consuetudinem huiusce hospitae, given to Davus. Th. Birt (Rbein. Mu·
seem, vol. LIV, 1899, p. 216), proposes propter huiusne cons. hospitas.
The best correcti0n (followed by Flecln) is that of H. Sauppe, which
Iadopt. Num has been lost because of num ln the previous lius.
Dn's conjecture of eius before propser Is obJ'eotionable, because no
pronoun is needed in view of tlte preceding illi.

441. nosti: Fleck. reads nostin after D, but the evidence of M
goes to prove thet nosti was the original readiog of the D family (see
Schlec, p. 36). With the exception of Spen, editors place a mark
of interrogation alter nosti.

442. edm rem reputauit uia: before reputouit several Mes. have
recto, wluch is certainly a gloss on uia. It Is omitted by P¹c10,
and was not in the text ol Donatus (see note). Flecln, however,
now retains it, reading id for eam rem. Drabeim (Hermes, vol. XV,
p. 239) shows thot in the third feet of the senarius an iamhic word is
permissible. So iu this play eras (717), sertim (745), uouit (774),
Curense (783), Crito (801). In all these cases except dabit (774)
Fleolr. proposes a change. In 540 we have a spondaio word (gnatam)
taking this place.
