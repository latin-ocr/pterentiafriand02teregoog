INTRODUCTION.

Fescennina per hunc inventa licentia morem
Versibus alternis opprobria rustica fudit.

(Hor. Epist. 2. 1. 145.)

= “ Througb this iashion came into rogus the Fescennino license,
which in alternata verse poured forth rustic taunts.”

ᾶ The Fescennini versus, to which Horace here refers, take
their name either from the town of Fescennium in Etruria,
or, more probably, from the fact that a symbol of life (fosci-
nam) was often carried iu processioa in order to ward off
the evil eye. Such aphallio symbol was in common use
among the Greeks, and it is awell-known fact that the germ
of Greek conredy is to be found in tho rude phallic songs
sung in tho Dionysiae festivities.¹ The Fescennino verses,
as Horace points out, gradually became charged with per-
sonal abuse aud scurrility, so much so that their freedom
was restrained by a law of the Twelve Tables. The term,
however, continued to be used of bantering and abusive
verses of various kinds, such as those shouted by the sol·
diers in triumpha] processionS, and more especially those
sung in marriage festivities. The latter, and possibly the
former as well, were responsive in character.⁸

The epithalamio of Catullus are beautiful specimens of

Fescennines, in artistic form3 of. Catull. 61.126,-

No diu taceat procax
Fescennina iocatio ;

and, for their amoebaean character, ib. 62. 18,-

Dicere iom incipient, iarn respondere decebit.

Romani, was onlarged, and three years later the first stage

lh specimen ot these songs, set ln literary form, may be seen in
