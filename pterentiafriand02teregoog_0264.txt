the adjective even in such apassage as Verg. Geor. 1. 242, Hic certes
nohis necuter sublimis, or Aea. 2. 259; 11. 01. This view, so oom-
monly heid by scholare, is overthrown by W. Heraeus in a convincing
article in Philologus, vol. LV (1896), pp. lei-212. We can now saieip
return to the reading sublimem, retaining the traditional order subii·
mem hunc intro rope. ·

864. eoo iam te commitam reddam: Dz. makes thereme iambic
hy scanning eei. This cannot be admitted. Schlee suggests rope
bsiore epo. Fleck. (see Neue Jahrb. Jiir Philolopie, 1800, p. 296)
makes a violent change to eoo ti condano muitum reddam. We must
accept the verse as a trochaie septenarius.

868. 0.· thus P (warren).

888. From here to the end of the play, with the exception oi
903-912‚ the Bembinus (A) inavailable.

882. hiae ciuem: the order oi A and D. Other Mes. give ciuem
iiac; so Klotz and Speu. Curionsiy enough in v. 008 hinc ciuem 13
read by γ, while ciuem hiscis there given hyd (including Bentley’s
10 Δ xli).

894. epo audiam-i qnid epo audiam: the second epo is original
in P C G 11, and a correction in A and D. Itis retained by flecis..

885. epe dicet, sino: thiais the punctuation oi Bent. Dz. Speu.
Others give ope, dicat sino.

898. hanc omittere: Mse. have harto uia omittere (caniciem, 1)).
Most editors retain ais, and read mittere. Flech. drope 01330010-
tains omittere. It is easy to account ior nie as an uunecessary repe·
tition, end amittere (= dimittere) is very common iu Terence; ci.

908. Cn. Hic. Cn. Simo mea quoeris? Si. Eho iacto: Mes.
are uncertain es to the distribution oi the parts in this line. D E G
(so Klotz and Meis.) malie Simo begin with mea quamn? bnt it seems
decidedly better to give this question to Crito, who has come out to
satisiy Simo's doubts. 1 therefore follow C, which is the most satis-
factory, and 13 accepted by Bent. Wag. Dz. Spen. In his second
edition Fleck. reads: Cn. Hic Simoni. Cn. Men quaeris?

reading is antehoc. ’
