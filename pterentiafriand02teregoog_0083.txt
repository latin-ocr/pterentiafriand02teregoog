(2) The verbs scissor and abutor take the accusative3 see
note on operam obst-itur (5).

(3) The use of the terminal accusative, illustrated by
11661616 end rus, is further exemplified by viciniora (70).

(4) 'Phe ablativo with a gerundivo is used as an ablativo
61 circumstance3 61. mirando bono (938). ¹

(5) Verbal nouus in 416 may take the construction 61 a
verb, as well as 61 a noun. Thus exprobratio (44) governs a
dative; itione (202) is nrodified by an adverb3 and 66611661
(400) is equivalent to carendum est.

(6) The subject accusative is often omitted with an in-
finitive; cf. fatetur transtulisse (14), occupavisse (145), etc.

(7)(16661161166611611)1 subordinate are often treated as
independent, and therefore retain their original mood3 cf.
dic, quidest? (45); diceret, qcid sect l (138).

(8) The indicative is often used instead of a deliberative
subjunctive, as adcon(e) ad eum? (315). We also find the
indicativo in a (1616616666, expressive 61 anticipation 61
design, as in darn proficiscor (329); dum creo (114). In a
quom (cum) causal clause, Terence generally has the indica·
tive, but occasionally the subjunctive; 61. 488, 623, 944.

(9) The imperative subjunctive is freely used in the pres
ent tense, even with a definite subject3 61. quiescas (598),
babeas (649).

(10) 16 ρ1ο11111111666,116 with the present imperative is
common. See note on oe nepo (384).

(11) Conditions contrary to fact are often treated as con·
tingent. Hence the present instead 61 a past tense 61 the
subjunctive, as in tu st blesis (310) ; 61. 914, 918.

(12) In regard to tenses, we find the present often used
instead 61 the future, to express speedy movement; 61. re-
vertor (485); renuntio (594). It is also used for vividness‚
as in fit (244), focis (322), adeo (315). For the same reason,
the historical present is very common3 61.128,133,148,
etc.
