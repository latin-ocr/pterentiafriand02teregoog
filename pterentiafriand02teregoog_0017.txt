lines could possibly lend color to the theory that Saturnian
verse depended on quantity alone. The opposite view, that
the measure is fundamentally accentual, was apparently
held by Servius, who, in commenting on Vergil, Geory.
2. 385, says of the Saturnian metre, quod cd rhythmum solum
camaras componere consueverunt.

The accentual theory is now generally accepted, and is
certainly more satisfactory as a working principle. As it
has an important bearing on the peculiarities of Plautus
and Terence, it will be well to give it in brief.¹

Like the metres of English verse, the Saturnian, instead
of being dependent on the quantity (long or short) of
syllables, was controlled by the arcent of words. Eacb
line consisted of two portioris, the first of which regularly
contained three accents aud seven syllables, the second, two
accents and six syllables. The initial syllable of every line
was accented. Words of four or more syllables admitted
two accents, primary and secondary. Alliteration was avery
common feature. The common type is ilhrstrated by the
opening line of Livius’ Odysaey, -

Virum mihi, camena, ll insece versutum,

or by the well-known line with which the Metelli threatened
Naevius,-
Dabunt malum Metelli ΙΙ Naevio poetae.

n We have now considered briefly the elements of a
native drama, which are to be found in Rome, independent
of the literature imported from Graece. That these early
Italian entertainrnents not only paved the way for the
genuine drama, by developing a taste for scenio art among -
the people, but even to a certain ,extent left their iurpress,

ι if not upon all Roman comedy, at least upon those plays
