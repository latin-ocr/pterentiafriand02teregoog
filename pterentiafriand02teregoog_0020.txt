15. Of the forms of Greek literature which were made
familiar to the Romans by Livius and his successore, comedy
was far tbe most popular. This species, which originated
in the revels connected with the nature-god Dionysus, had
passed through various stages of development and evolved
avar-iety of literary forms. Two main lines of historical
development ruay be traced, one leading to the various forms

reflections on life and nature, which were not without
