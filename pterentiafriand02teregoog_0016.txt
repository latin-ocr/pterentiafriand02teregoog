Σ INTRODUCTION.

was, in the best days of Roman comedy, used chiefly as an
candiana. Mirans, however, did not receive literary trent
ment until the later days of the Republic. At that time
their subject-matter was enlarged, and gradually they
absorbed or displaced all other forms of drama, and were
composcd down to the latest period of the Empire.

9. The Atellanae (so. sabnlae), so called from Atella, a
small town in Campania, were brought from their Oscan
surroundings to Rome after the reduction of Campania in
the second Punic war (211 n.c.). The performers were
generally young patriciana, who wore masks and spoke in
Latin. Though the plots were pre-arranged, the dialogue

the time of Sulla, at the hands of Pomponius and Novius.
Like the saturae and mhires, they, too, were used as after-
plays, but in the early Empire they became merged in the
pantomime.

10. In all these early thanatio forms, prior to the intro
duction of Greek literature into Rome, such parts as were
not mere conversation were undoubtedly composed in Satur-
nian verse, a native Italian metre, which was very different
in character from the measures adopted by the cultivated
poets of later days, Livius Andronicus, it is true, used it
in his translation of the Odyssey, as did Naevius in his epic
poem on the first Punic war, bnt Ennius and succeeding
poets speak of it with contempt.

The precise nature of the Saturnian measure was dis-
puted among the Romans themselves. The grammarians,
who were familiar only with quantitative matres, tried to
explain it on the analogy of Greek measnres, but only a few
