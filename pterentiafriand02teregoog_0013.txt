“ 'lhey disport with rude verses and laughter unrestrained, aud
put on hideous masks of hollow ooth, and call on thee, OBac-
chus, with joyous sanga and to thee hang waving amuleta from
the tall pine.'’

Here, besides merry songs and jests, we have the dramatis
clement of disguise, which is also referred to by Tibullus
(2. 1. 55) in connection with the songs and danccs in celebra-
tion of the Ambarvalia:-

Agrioola et minio suffusus, Bacche, rubenti.

Among the many passages which tell us of these rustic fes
tivities, when, as Lucretius (5.1398) says,

Agrestis enim tum Musa vigebat,

are Horace, Ourna. 3.18 (Faunalia); ovid, Fasti, 2. 655 ff.
(Terminalia), 3. 523 (festival of Anna Perenna), and 5. 183 ff.
(morata). '

⁵. The scngs sung in these country festivals were doubt·
less rude, extemporaneous¹ effusionS, the epitheta commonly
applied to them being incorreposr'ti, irrcompti, medes, and incoa-
dira but a dramatis feature, which was developed at an
early time, was their amoebaean or responsive character.
This is scen in the ancient hymn of the Arval Brethren‚²
the oldest existing specimen of a Latin poem, which was
chanted responsively and accompauied by danoing. The
same characteristic is seen iu the rustic singing-matches,
which Vergil idealizes in his third, fifth, and eighth
Eoisque&-

Alternis dicetis; amant alterna Camenae (3. ts).

Compare, t00, the statement of Horace, who, after describing
a merry harvest-home, when the early farmers, with their
wives and children, made offeriugs to the gods, adds:—

Ῑποιήματα αὐτοσχέδια (Dionys. Halicar. 7. 72).
