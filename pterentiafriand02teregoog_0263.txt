850. Da. Mtttnv Si. Tibi ergo. Dr. Modo huo ir' iutro.
Sr. Quasi ego quom (iudum rogem: blas. have ereo modo introii
(introi C). D has eoo (underscored) beiore modo, and most editors
regard it as necessary in the reconstruction. However, as Spengel
says, in D it is probably a mere repetition oi erpo. llz. deletes epo
after quasi, and before morlo scans epo as an iambus, which cannot
be allowed. Bentley introduced iui (accepted by Umpf. Wag. Meis
Spcn. and formerly Fleck.), but the full forms of ire, as is shown by
Engelbrecht (ll'ieuer Studien, vol. VI. p. 232), are nowhere found 111
Terence, and very rarely iu Plautus. The line proposed by Engel·
brecht himself, viz. :—

Milrin? Tibi ergo. Ego modo ii intro. Quasi ego quarn dudum rogem,

iails to give oredo the emphasis here required by the context, hutls
otherwise satisfactory enough. Probably, however, the best reading
is that now given hy Fleck, who rejects the intruder ego, gives modo
its proper place under the ictus, and supposes that huc, which corre-
sponds well with istic (819), has fallen out before ti.

857. tostis ueritas: 0 has ueritum other Mss. seueritas, but in P

this appears asiieritos (Warren, Aruer. Jour. os etit, vol. 111, p. 00),

and inC as Queritos ; secernas is also given hy Servius (on Verg. Aea.
10. 612; Geor. 3. 37). In Neue Jahrb. scir Philologie (1890), p. 295,
Fleck. brings iorward a number oi passages from Cicero, Tacitus,
Petronius, etc, to illustrate the combinatiou oi tristis and scamus, or

“ oi tristitia and seueritas ,· cf. (eg.) Cic. de Orat. 2. 5 289, voltus sere·
rior et tristior. On the other hand, the very frequency of such com·
binations may account ior ueritas being supplanted hy secentas. ll
seueritas is accepted, we must either allow a sudden change to the
lambio metre, ior tristis se-is not pemnissible, or we must read with
Fleck„ tristis ost seueritas irt uoltis. Furthermore‚ ueritas was read
here by Nonius (p. 109, 20) ; tristis ueritas, ‘earnestness oi truth,’ is
a striking and appropriate expression3 and, lastly, we here need a
word which will be parallel in meaning, not to lustrabat tofldes.
The reading caerites is accepted by Klotz. Wag. Dz. Spen.

858. equidem: Spcn. gives quidem, contrary to the Mss.

861. sublimem: h'leck. (1851) introduced the form sublimen lnto
this passage, as well as Ad. 316, in accordance with the conclu-
sions of Ritschl, iiheiu. Muscam, 1850, p. 556; cf. Ο. Ribbeck, Jahrb,
1858, p. 184. Klotz stood out unsuccessiully against sublimen,
which is generally accepted in these two Terentian passages and in
(ey.) Plaut. ileu. 991, 991, 1001, 1052. Ribbeck substituted it ior
