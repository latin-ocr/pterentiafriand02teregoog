its diction, proving the author to be a perfect master of the
art of expression. The grammarians and critica of the
· republican period, who were in a much better position than
their successore of imperial times to appreciata the difficul-

ties, in respect to language, which confronted the early
writers, speak of the style of Plautus in eulogistic terms.
Cicero compares it with that of the best Greek poets, in
exhibiting iocandi genus elegans, urbanum, ingeniosum, soce-
tum :¹ and Aelius Stilo, whose opinion used to be quoted by

his pupil, the learned Varro, is said to have deelared that
this would have bben the style followed by the Muses them·
selues, had they spoken in Latin.²

As to the dramatic art of Plautus, we have already seen
that Horace's judgmeut was distinctly unfaworable. He
accuses him of being careless aud slipshod,

Securus cadat an recto stet fabula telo (Epist. 2. 1. 176),

and it would be easy to bring forward evidence in support
of this criticism. At the same time, he isone of the world’s
greatest humorists, who besides being immensely popular
iu his own day, has exerted a powerful influeuce on the
literature of modern times. A noble tribute to his genius
is the epitaph, in dactylic hexameters, which Gellius gives
as the composition of Plautus himself: ³ -

Postquam est mortem aptus Plautus, Comoedia luget,
Scaena est deserta ac dein Risus, Ludus Iocusque,
Et Numeri innumeri simul omnes conlacrumsrunt.
