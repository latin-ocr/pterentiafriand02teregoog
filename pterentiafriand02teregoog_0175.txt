ACT 1. schim 2.

We must suppose that instead of following Sosia immediately, Simo
lingere behind to refleet upon the situation. lle remembers the dismay
shown by Davus on hearing of the approaching wedding, and suspects
that tho slave, working in the interests of Pamphilus, will do his best to
prevent it. At this moment Davus himself appears. ln tire following
dialogue Simo threatens the slave with severe penalties if he tries to
put any obstacles in his way.

a causai particle. modo: i.e. just before the opening of the play,

The lambio senarii maire way ln line lit ior lambio lines oi either

ai, cf. Prona. 490, mirabar ei tu milti quiequam adferret noui. So
Cicero, Loci. 15. 54, miror si qrrernquom ornicum babere potuit. Corn-
mon is mirum ui. See Λ. fr G. 333. ilem.; G. 542. notes 1 and 2. The
siolause is not a subordinate question, but a real conditional clause.
Mirabar: mirum erat, and is therefore similar to such frequent ex-
pressions as lonyum eret, difficile erut, pur erut, etc, where the English
idlorn requires the subjunctive. See Β. 271. 1. b; A. lt G. 311. e; G.
254. i. The Latin, in fact, is a mixture of two ideae: “ I was wondering
(mirabar) if matters would turn out thus,'' and “i should have been
surprised if matters had turned out thus (abiret).'' The English trans-
lation must choose between the two et eri semper, ete: ond from
,tim to lost Ι secred the outcome os my transter's indiffereuee. Davus
feared that this indifferenee was only apparent, not real. See App.
