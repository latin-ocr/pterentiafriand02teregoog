978. sluttere bne tu me; intua apua cesariana nunc: this is the
reading suggested by Dz. (adrsotctio critica), and seems the best, in
view of the Mes. evidence and the necessities of the case. A reads
sequere hac nse intusa Glycerium erisne (with aput, a correction for a) ;
the rest have apud, with eet after necne. Two facts to guide us in
reconstruoting the line are: that intas cannot possibly accompany
reperere, which would require intro, and that the ¹word Glycerium is
to be accented on the first syllable. Hence, our choice seems to lie
between Dn's suggestion, which 1 accept, and Spengel's, which Dm
bas given in his text, viz :—

sequare hac me intro: intus apud Glyceridmst nuno.

Thia latter, however, isrednndant in thought, while the former
really departs from A only in the introduction of tu, a slight but
effective addition, in view of the contrast it makes with ta Daue.

981. restet: so most editors, followingaand γ. Spengel strangely
follows the l group and Don, in reading restat.

In several minor Mes. of Terence there is found an additional soene
at the end of this play, the subject of which is the betrothal of
Charinus. DonnndEugsbothrefertothis scene,bntbothareinclined
to regard it as spurious. It is very corrupt in a few lines, and, unlike
any other final scene in Terence or Plautus, with the exception of the
latter's Poenulus, which is similar to the Andria in having a second
ending, closes in iambic trimeters. According to Grelfeld, De Andriae
Terentianae Gemino Exitu (Dies. Helle, 1886), n is to be assigned to
the last century of the Republic, when some of the Plautina prologues
were compoeed. It is probably the work of some grammarian who

. thought Charinus was disposed of in too summary a fashion. I
append the lines as given by Dz.
