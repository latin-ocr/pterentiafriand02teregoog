The passage has caused much trouble. Τ110 second line will not
scau, notwithstanding the attempts at making either 1 iberiae a trisyl-
lable (Faernus, Bit. Klotz, Wag. Umpf.) or sinendis dissyllable
(Meis). liqually impossible is Bentley’s libera or Spengel’s conjec-
ture oi ubi (accepted by Fleck.) or 01 ut-in each case without a
verb-for suit, and very harsh is Spengel's suggestion oi est. As
Weiss points out, liberior. . potestas iorms an apodosis which
clashes with the real epodosis in 05-00. Et or ac (Guyet and Bent.)
at the end oi a line is out oi the question (Conradt Hennes, vol. X,

preceding line.
