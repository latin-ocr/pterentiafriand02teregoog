Davus, the fallax wreus, is probably tlre most interesting
character of the Andria. He is a bold and ingenious
schemer, an abettor in an evil course (192), very impertirent
bohis master, and ready to do him an ill turn (162), yet not
without many good points. He is brave, and knowingly
runs the risk of severe penalties (210 ff.); he displays great
eagerness and activity (355); he is devoted to his master's
son, and, when his plans miscarry, he admits his defeat and
proposes the penalty due (621). ln his encounters with
Simo he shows much cleverness in repartee, aud his ability
to assume an air of injured innocense is very amusing (504).

Sosia, who is amere foil sor Simo in tlre opening soene,
has been a faithful slave, and is now regarded as a safe con·
fidant. He merely echoes his patron's words, throwing in
an occasional wise saw.

Byrria, the confidential slave of Charinus, has a low mind,
and can be very impudent to his master (316, 428 ff.).
Mysis is a simple, lrindly creature, who is as dull cf compre·
hension as Davus is clever. She is devoted tc her mistress,
and treats her with affectionate regard (685). Lesbia is said
to be careless and fond of tippling (229); after the fashion
of her lrind, she loves to gossip (459), and issues her orders
with a professional air. Glycerium, a modest, beautiful,
and affectionate girl, becomes known to us only through the
descriptione of others.
