66161, 116 will do nothing in excess. He is an easy-going
man, indulgent to his son, whose welfare he earnestly
desines, and a good master to his slaves (36). Unfilial oon·
duct cuts him to the quiok (869), and deception he cannot
tolerate (902). For this he bittcrly reproaches his 6611
(87211), and severely punishes his 61616 (865). Η6 is no
match for cunning, and though, 61616 stage, he gets the
better of the wily Davus, yet he is ignorant 61 the fact, and
with ingenuous candor confesses to the slave his attempt 16
take him in. Though usually polite and suave in his deal·
ings with others, yet if his suspicions are aroused 116 can be
curt and even rude 16 6116113616 (968). Η16 prevailiug good-
temper (175), however, wins the day, if, notwithstanding
1116 disobedience 61 others, happy results are finally secured
(948, 956).

Chremes plays but 6 small part in the play. He is 6
good friend to Simo, and a fairly good father to Philumena,
whoru he wishes tc see well married. Yet though he recog·
nizes the risk of experimenting with a daughter's happiness,
he consents to her marriage with aman 61 doubtful char-
acter, in 1116 hope 61 refornring her husband (572). His
gentle and forgiving disposition is 66611 in the way that he
pleads withan augry father for an offending son (868, 894,
901, 903).

Charinus, the friend of Pamphilus, figures only as the
lover of Philumena, to secure whom is the sum total 61 1116
ambition (306). Mistrust 61 his friend is but 6 temporary
result 61 apparent treachery (64311). He soon realizes the
true position 61 Pamphilus, whose unhappiness, he admits,
is equal 16 his own (162).

Crito is 6 good, honest soul, who would not wrong Glyce-

rium, even though the law ison his side. His character is
well described in the line (857),-
