In place of ne· followed by rand s, the original aa· is re·
tained, as in noster, nario, adversarias, though ne· was prob·
ably coming in in Terence’s time.l For the later cuins, cni,
cnr, and cnm Terence uses quoius, qenai, qnor, and 00001, and
similarly, ior the syllables cres, cnm, and cieret, Terence
uses -qnos, paam, and quarn, eg. antiquos, equam, relin-
perant.

82 In gerunds and gerundives of the third and fourth
conjugations, a is frequently found, as wellas e; cf. seri·
braerrdns (5) as well as scribendam (1). So we have a for later
i in lubet, lacrnma, and in most superlatives, as optamus,
prominens (but i after r aad n, as acerrimas and minimas,
and sometimes after l, as facilli-me as well as facillume, 65).

The substantires piratas and privata retain their original p.

83 111 words componnded with prepositions, Terence
does not, as a rulo, assimilata thelina] consonant of the
prefix with the initial consonant of the simple word. In
certain consonantal combinations,² however, we find assimi-
lation employed, as well as in certain words in common use,
and in such compounds as are no longer felt as such.
Thus, in the best Mss. we regularly find adpellere (l), ad·
cnrrere (lat), adferre (189), adsta-ilas (247), adpredi (670),
adlepare (899), adparare (656), adplicare (193), adportare
(73), adprime (61), adtemperaie (916), but accedere (123),
accersere (299), accidere (264), accneare (19), apparere (594),
attinere (789), attinere (187). So, too, inlicere (911), inla-

¹ Sciplo Africanus is said to have first made the change. See Qnin-
tilian, 1. 7. 25. Mes. give (aa.) both torto and verta.
