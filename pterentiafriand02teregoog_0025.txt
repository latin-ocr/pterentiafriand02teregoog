Persona] aud political satire, though by no means extinct,
' have left but few traces in the New Comedy, which is 00000-
tially a comedy of manners, taking its characters from every·

day life and mildly caricaturing the follies of mankind in
general. These characters, however, resemble those of
Epicharmus, being generic, not individual, and including
such common types as the stern father, the wayward sou,

a pupil of Plato and Aristotle, was one of his teachers, while
Epicurus, the philosopher, was, from boyhood, his most
intimate friend. The social circle in which Menander lived
was thus extremely favorable ior the development of his
literary genius, and his first play was brought out at the
early age of twenty, in the year of Demosthenes' death. The
total number of his plays is said to have been one hundred
aud eight, but'none of these survive, except in disconnected
fragments We are told that only eight times did he wiu
