ACT 111. sellun 4.

Α new scene begins here in' the middle claime, the action going
on without a break. This never occurs in Plautus.

have come to an understanding, and that the marriage is ιο pro
ceed.

ing oi comit threads is very elever, and amusing. With ingenucue
candor, Simo makes confession to the rascally Davus oi his attempt to
