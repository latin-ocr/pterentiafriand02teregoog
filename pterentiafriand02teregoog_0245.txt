B, however, is more akin to γ than to 8. The order 01 plays in X was
chronological, but ln 1110 archetype 01 δ alphabetical.¹ Theline of
descent 10 which D belongs probably involved more frequent copying
111011 that iu which P occurs, and “frequent copying, however well
done, corrupte the 10111.”2

upon which every editor of Terence rnust, for the present,8 base hle

by Warren, llauler‚ and Schlee. Warren 011010 001110 corrections of

Besidee Umpfenbacb's work, there are many valuable editione of
Terence, which an editor must carefully study. Of the older ones,
hy far the most important is that of the English Bentley (Cambridge,
1726 ; Amsterdam, 1727). This edition, rightly described by Sohanz
aa machemaodeud, is still a most valuable work, and no one, perhaps,
lsin a better position 10 appreciata the marvellous learning and 01111001
women of Richard Bentley than is the editor of Terence. The edition
by Westsrhovius(The Hague, 1726 ; reprintbysahbaum‚1,erpeic,1830)
Israluable, mainly because it contains the commentary of Donatus,
but both 11110 and the scholia 01 Eugraphius are given in the edition by
Klotz (Leipsic, 1838-1839). Fleckeisen's Terence was first published
1111857, in the Teubner series (Leipsic). Α second edition appeared
fortyone years later, in 1898. A comparison of the two editions
shows a remarkable number of textual differenoes. Very valuable is
llziatzlro's edition (Leipsic, 1884), with its adnotatio critica, Of 1110
special editions of the Andria, the best are those by lilotz (Leipsic,
