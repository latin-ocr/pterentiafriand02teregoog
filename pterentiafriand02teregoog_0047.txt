istic of the prose of Plato and the verse of Menander, Terence
managed to import for the first time into Latin a century
before Cicero wrote any of his extant Epiatles.

But excellence of style is not the only artistic feature of
Terence's plays. In the delineation of his characters the

·' author shows fine discrimination and taste. To be sure,
they are less vividly outlined than are those of Plautus,
and it is somewhat confusiug to find the same names fig·
uring in different plays. But in the analysis of the finer
shades of character, in the blending of motives and in con-
sistency of portrayal, Terence shows the utmost dramatic
skill.

In the construction of Terenoe’s plays the incidente and
soenes follow one another in smooth and harmonious order,
and contribute logically and naturally to the development
of the plots. The latter, though somewhat monotonous‚ are
skilfully worked out, and, as compared with those of the
Plautino plays, usually show more complexity, due partly
to the systematic use of contamination. Thus the main
action is regularly attended by an underplot, as in the
Aadn'o the intrigne of Pamphilus and Glycerium is accom-
panied by the love of Charinus for Philumena. Yet the
fundamental dramatic law-the law of unity of action, or
l'unr'te d’inreret, as the French critics call it-is faithfully
observed in every Terentian play.

The subjects of Terenoe's plots are of course the stock-
subjects of New Comedy, but are more limited in range
than those of Plautus. The prinoipal motr'f is that which
has ever since held sway in the drama‚- the sentiment of
love3 and this, so far as the lower moral tone of Athenian
life allowed, is treated in a manner approaohing the modern

faahion. The genuine affection of a young man for a girl,
who is dowerless or a social outcast, or even a slave, encoun-
tera paternal opposition, which finally disappears on the
girl’s turning out to be freeborn or a long-lost daughter of
