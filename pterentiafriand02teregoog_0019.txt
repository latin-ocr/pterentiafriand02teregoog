THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROMAN comani. xiil

παιδαγωγοί, if they were talented and cultivated, they were
generally set free and lived 00 libertini. Many freeborn
Greeks, 000, were attracted to Rome bythe expectation of mak-

> Rome, and thus, too, that Roman literature found a begin-
ning. For more than a century, we find that the representa-
tives of literature in Rome are almost without exception
non-Romans, men who were familiar with both the Greek
and Latin languages, and wh0, through translations, adep
tations, and imitations of the Greek masterpieces, prepared
the ground on which the literature of the classical period
dourished.
This Hellenizing of Rome begins with Livius Andronicus,
0 Greek from Tarentum, who was brought to Rome in
275 s.o.‚ and set up a school, iu which he taught his pupils
the Odysaey, translated by himself into Saturnian verse. In
the year after the close of the first Punic war, 00 brought
out his first play (240 no.) translated from the Greek,
and from then cn Greek plays were regularly exhibited
in Rome. During the second Punic war literary activity
was represented by 000 dramatists Naevius and Plautus, and
before its close the poets, who had hitherto 0000 despised
as a class,¹ were recognized by the state and allowed to form
a collegium (206 00). In 204 ne, 0000, 000 great opponent
of Hellenism, brought to Rome Ennius, the most conspicu-
ous Hellenizing agent, and therefore there is ample truth in
the well-known epigram of Porcius Licinus, as given iu
