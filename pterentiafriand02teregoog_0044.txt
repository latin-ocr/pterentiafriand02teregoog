bitter and personal as fresh plays appeared, and to this
criticism Terence shows himself very sensitive. His ill-
wishers -isti malivoli- claimed that his plays were feeble
in sentiment and style, -

Tenui esse oratione et scriptura levi¹ (Phorm. 5) ;

that Terence was an upstart in the literary profession, who
was dressed in horrowed plumes, -

Repente ad studium hunc se adplicasse mrisicum,
Andrum ingenio fretum, haud natura sua (Hecat. ta);

and finally, that he was guilty of plagiarism (Ean. 23 f.).

In regar-d to the last count, it is interesting to leam that
this serious charge of sartum² has no reference to the Greek
originale employed, but only to earlier Latin poets. Pro
fessional otiquette demanded that when a writer had turned
a Greek play into Latin, that play should be considered his
peculiar property. To this charge Terence pleads ‘not
guilty,’ either elaiming that he wasignorant of any pre-
vious use of the play, or proving that his own was entirely
new.

The story that Terence's plays were either wholly or
partly composed by some ot his noble friends, -

Nam quod isti dicunt malivoli, homines ndbilis
Hune adiutare adsidueque una scribere (Ad. 15), -

was firmly believed by many ancient writers,³ mainly, we
may suppose, because it was precisely the kind of story that
Terence could not well refuta, inasmueh as it was favorable
