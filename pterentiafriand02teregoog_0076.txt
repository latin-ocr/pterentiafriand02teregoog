‘ta Only one musician (tibicen) performed, his instrument
being the tibia, a word usually translated as flate, though
the instrument bore a stronger resemblance to the modern
clarinet or oboe, and was also stronger and shriller than our
flute. It was provided with finger-heles, varying from five
to fifteen, had a cylindrical bore, and was blown by means
of a mouthpiece at the end.

In the accornpaniment of Latin plays, the tibicen always
used two tibiae, or pipes, each with its own mouthpiece. Α
bandage (capistrum), passing ovcr the mouth and cheeks of
the performer and provided with holes to receive the mouth-
pieces‚ relieved the pressure of the pipes, and the musi-
cien was thus enabled to play on both pipes at the same
time. The melody of the nnrsic was played on the right-
hand pipe, the aceornpaniment, which was usually higher
than the melody, on the other.

The double pipes are described as either perosor impares,
ie. either equal or unequal in length. In the latter case,
the longer pipe, which was held iu the left hand, is repre·
sented in artas always curved at the end larthest from the
mouth, and usually as terrninating in a bell. The tibiae
impares are frequently called Phrypiun, a term which, like
Lydios, applicable to the tibiae peres, has reference to the
Greek musical modes The tibine potes were two straight
pipes of equal length. Of these, however, there were some
varieties. Thus, according to Donatus, the Andria was per-
formed tibiis paribus, deutris et sinistris, while the Mss.
mention the duce destruc in connection with the Eunuchus.
The sarronae, also peres, were perhaps shorter than the

Greek music. see Naurnann's History os Mrtsic, edited by Sir F. Gore
