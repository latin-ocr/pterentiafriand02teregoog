Terence practically confines himself to the iambic and tro·

’ Latin names—eg. 00110111ιο, septenariae, cacciarius—from
the number of individual feet which each line contains. 111
Greek poetry, however, these rneasures are based upon unite

four feet is known 00 adimetenone 01 six 1001 ae atrimeter,
and so on. In an iambic dipody (0-0-) the Greeks
allowed the substitution 01 0 spondee (>-) 01 0 dactyl

chaic dipody (-υ -υ) the corresponding substitutione 01 ,

spondee and anapaest ( -) were allowed only in the .

second half. The disregard 01 this sule, 01 the loss of
distinction between odd anderen feet, constitutee the main
metrioal difference between Latin and Greek comedy. In
Plautus and Terence, substitutione and resolutione are, with
certain exceptione, allowed in any 1001.
