aa. In addition to those already mentioned, a few other
comic poete are included in the canon oi Volcatius Sedigi-
tus,¹ but little is known about thern. Turpilius, the seventh
on the list, is represented by thirteen titios, all iu Greek.
He composed palliatae only in his earlier liie; for half a
century before his death, in 103 rac, the productiori of
palliatae had ceased, and such of them as were afterward
exhibited were the stock plays oi the old poets.²

Since we possess the worlrs oi only two comic poets of
Rome, it is impossible to determine how reasonable is the
verdict oi Sedigitus, in whose judgment Terence deserves

only the sixth place of honor:-

Multas incertos cartam hano rem vidimus,
Palmam poetae cenrico cui deferant.

Eum med iudicio errarem dissolvam tibi,
Ut, cantra si quis sentiat, nil sentiat.
Caecilio palmam Statio do mimico;

Plantas secundus iacilc exsuperat ceteros3
Dein Naevius, qui fervet, pretio in tertiost3
Si erit quod quarto detur, dabitur Licinio.
Post insequi Licinium iacto Atilium5

Iu sarto consequatur hos Terentius ;
Turpilius septimam, Trabea octavum aptaret,
Nono loco esse iacile iacio Luscium 3
Decimum addo causa antiquitates linaium.⁸

luto vogue, such as the teactae, Atellanae, and the minace.
