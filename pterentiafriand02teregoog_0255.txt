1116111111. 161

447. aliquantum: aliquantulum isgiven in D Ε and Don. Hence
Bent. aliquantillum, to which Fleck. now returns, reading nicusi. The
double diminutive is used by Plautus, but occurs nowhere in Terence.

449. quid id est, etc: Bentley's 15 A XII gives the order adopted
in the text. So Fleck. and Schlee (Wdlfflin’s Archiv, vol. III, p. iso)

in view oi the climax. Theline is commonly given
Quidudmst? Puerilest. Quid idest? Nil. Quin dic, quidest?

451. citonatus: on the deponent form see Engelbrocht, Stadia
Terent, p. 49. Most oi the editors follow Beni, who adhered to
obsonatum. Not so Klotz, Ritter, Wag, and now Fleck.

459. dixisti: all Mes. except two of Bentley’s have dieti (so
spen). Donatus knew of the variant dicisti, which is given by
Bent. Umpf. Dz. and is preferred by Engelbrecht (Studia Terent,
11119).

478. hicine me: this is undoubtedly the correct reading, but -ae
isnot interrogative, aa Spen. would have it. (See Warrcn's article
On the Euclitic ·ne in Early Latin, in Anser. Jour. of Phil, vol. Il,
1881, p. 50.)

483. sac islarn ut lauet ; poste deinde: most editors give ista ut, 66
ln P 111111 0. Engelbrecht (Wiener Studien, vol. VI, p. til) provee
that islam is correct, used proleptically. Don. knew the reading islam Ἰ
as object of lauet, and his attempt to read isla in the same construo-
tion, isla quae ec puerperio sordebant, points to the same original.
'l'he Bembina Schol, on Ad. 3. 4. 36, gives sace illam ul lauet.

Fleck.’s poste for post is necessary, aa deinde isalways a dissylla-
ble in Terence. See Skutsch in Hem. vol. xxxii, p. el. Umpf. and
Meis. accept poete. Engelbrecht (Studia Terent, p. 73) argues
against poete, hut in Wiener Studien, vol. V, p. 218, 116 is also dueat-
lsfled with deinde as a trisyllabis, and therefore proposes

nunc primum fac istam ut leuetur, post deinde.

488. est ueritus: Mss. give uentus est, but most editors follow
Bentley in reversing the order. Meis prefers huice ueritust. See
Fleck. in Neue Jahrb. sir Philoloaie, 1891, p. 670.

490. quid opus seclo esset: so Mss. Fleck. gives qnid sacto esset
opus, Eugr. having sacto opus esset. Draheim (Hennes, vol. XV,
p. 110) approves of Fleclr.’s conjecture.

499. non sint tibi renuntiata: the common reading is non tibi r.
sint, which produces 611 octonarius with neither diaeresis nor the fifth
foot caesura. The Mss. show uncertainty, and Dz. and Fleck. are
warranted in changing the position of sint.
