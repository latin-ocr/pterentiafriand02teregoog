raosonr. lix

All Latin words were once accented on the first syllable,
and sdcilins (eg.) must represent the pronunciation which
still prevailed in the time of Plautus, but which in Ter·
encs’s day was giving way to the later facilins, mullerem,
eto. Quadrisyllabic words with the scansion - υ υ aa usu-
ally take, in Terence, the ictus upon the second syllable,
ag. dissimili (11 and 12), but sometimes upon the first, eg.
anesca (rs); of. quamohrem, aas. arana. 492, Aa cro,
and quondoquidem, Andr. 487, 608, Heaut. 1064, Aa. 956.

δι Owing to the prominence naturally given to an
accented syllable, adjacent long syllables are often, in dra-
matis poetry, reduced to short ones. Hence the sooalled
iaarhio low¹ according to which a long syllable may be
shortened, when it is preceded by a short, and either pre-
ceded or followed by the acoent of a word or word-group, or
by the verse-ictus. Thus ό - may become ό υ, and υ A
may become υ υ ἐ. The short syllable preceding the
shortened long must be a monosyllable or begin a word.
The long syllable which is shortened is usually (a) a mono-
syllable, (b) the long syllable of an lambio word, or (c) the
first syllable of a polysyllabis word3 least commonly (d) the
second syllable in a polysyllable. The only illustrations of
(d) found in the Andria are oohlptdti (944) and voldptdtes
(960). The following may serve as illustrations of the
other cases:—

(α) et ld prdtum, 42; epo la pdrtu, 4803 aed hie Pam-
philus, 462.

(b) dabit adoro, 396; satin adorta, 749.

(c) sia(e) invidio, 663 cosma) ingenium, 466.

In the text, all cases of syllables shortened by tho iambic
law are marked υ.

¹Called lambio, because the long syllable thus affected naturally
forms an iambus (u ,) with the preceding short.
