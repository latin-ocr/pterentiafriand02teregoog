THE Davatot’nanr OF ROMAN COMEDY. xv

caricatured mythological legende, iu accordauce with the
merl-yandrew spirit of the primitiva Dionysiae revcls,
when rustic performers sang and danced through the vil-
lages, and clothed themselves in the skins of beasts or
stained their faces with pigments, and thus assumed the
part of Satyrs, Fauus, or Sileni, the fabled attendants of
Dionysus.

1⁷. Another type of this Doric or Sicilian comedy was
the socalled mimus, written in prose, in which were depicted
single soenes from daily life. This form was brought to
perfectior by Sophron, who flourished in Syracuse a century .
later than Epicharmus, and whose literary work appealed
strongly to Plato We may form some idea of the attrac-
tive character of Sophrou's animes from the fifteenth idyl of
Theocritus, which is said to be an imitation of Sophron's ·
Isthmiuzuaue. Metrical animes, composed by Herodes, an
Alexandrian writer, were discovered a few years ago in
Egypt.

la Still another form of Dorio comedy is that which the
Romans called mutuentur, because developed by Rhinthcn
of Tarentum (flor. 300 aa), and which, as being a per-
formanoe of olowus, was called Pldyacea¹ ln the Phlyaces,

. the myths of tragedy were travestied, for which reason

Rhinthon's comedy is sometimes called lhupovpuyollu, ie.
tragicooomoedr'o. The Amphitruo of Plautus, which has a
mythological plot, is thought by some to show Rhinthon's
influeuce.²

The varicus forms of Sicilian comedy, growing out of the
early Dorio Feros, were without a chorus, for whatever song
or dance was required by the entertainment was furnished
by the actors themselves.

¹ φλύαξ is a Dorio form of φλύαρος, u ailly clown.
