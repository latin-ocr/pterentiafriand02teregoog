Spen. Fleck.) is excluded. See note on 10. On the other hand,
quod εἰ eye rescissem (Dz.) is impossible. Mes. also have nant
me royet (nuno is omitted ογ Don. and Eugr.); spen. omits me,
Fleck. uano. Hauler approves oi the scansion doute, on the analogy
oi siquidem (idonior-Da, Pione„ p. 55). The best way to deal with
the difficulties ol the line seems to he to return to Bentley'soonjeoture,
un:—

Quod si ego scissem ld prius, quid iacerem, sl quis nuno me interroget.

Interroyet eomes from Eugr.

265. out aliquid de iiio me aduersum iane ioqui : Mes. According
to most editors, either aliquid or de iilo must go, Spen. retains oli·
quid, hut, as Bent. says, “de ilio” profecto hio neeessariam est ; nisi
enim de Glycerio loqueretur, quid od remi Fleok., however, ογ
transposing aliquid and de ilia, is able to keep both. lle also trans-
poses norro and peropost, which is nnneoessary.

268. die: P1con. So Dz. and Spen. Diem (dii, P2)ispreferred
ογ Bent. Umpi. Meis. Fleck„ notwithstanding its unusual position.

270. Mss. except G give hera before egone. Dz. and Fleck.
reject it. Even li retained, lte metrioal effect is praetioally lost ·

276. uereor: so l’ (Warren), D² B and M (Sohlee, p. 18); wear
(D1 0) is read ογ editors generally. Warren now thinks that-or in
P was iu rasura.

iu te sit solo situm, G and R (Bent’s 15 Α XII), but solo sit situm,
reli. codices. Umpf. and Speu. take the latter, hut more monotouous
reading. See Brix iu Anhang on Plaut. Mil. 266.

281. scie, esse meritam: thus Bentley, omitting hone, which a
maid would hardly use in speaking oi her absent mistress lt is
omitted in γ, but all Moe. have the order meritam esse.

289. ln view oi Mes. uncertainty here, almost every editor has his
own corrections to offer. A study oi parallel passages (see note) will
show thot those of Dz., with

quod perego te hauc nune dextram oro et genitum tuom,

and oi Fleclr. (aiter Rein and followed in the text) are best.

296. fidei .· so the Mss. and now Fleek. See Introd. §85 (6).

299. accerso: both forms, arcesso and accerso, were used by Plautus ·
(so iu pune accersunt Acceruntem, Most. 509, and arcessis Arellium,
ileo. 130). ln Eoo. 510, P and Chare accere, D and G orcess-; ln
Eun. 592, D G alone have arceas· ; in Ad. 351, Α Pl D G E have accere,
12²0 F oreess-; iu Aci. 904, all Mes. give accere. ln Andr. 515,
