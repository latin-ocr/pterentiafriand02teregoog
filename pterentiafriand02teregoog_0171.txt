118. unam: equivalent ιο our indefinite article, or to quidam.

120. ut nll supra: colloquial brevity, sc. esse poesia· oi. Ao. 264,
Eua. 427. ln Cio. Ep. 14. 1. 4, and ad Αιι. 13. 19. 3. the verb is ex-
pressed. Donatus styles the idiom ellipsis Terentiano, and states that
lt did not meet with general approval. Note the art with which the
lether 'rs made to achnowledge the beauty of Glycerium. Alter euch
a confession, we do not expect very active opposition to his son’s de-
siretomarry her.

121. qula. . . praeter ceterae: the repetition oi these words in
122 ie in keeping with the emphatic style of Simo's narrative. The
second clause, ιοο, repeating hie former remark about the girl's beauty‚
illustrates the impression made upon Simo's mind, and also increases
our interest in Glycerium.

123. honesta ac liberali : comely aad penteel. So conlupio lihe-
ralr', 561. pedisequae: woitinp-womeu. Chrysis had become well
enough oli to keep a number oi servants; see 797. In Athens it was
only the very poorest citizens who had no slaves.

125. percussit ilico animum: ot once ο thonpltt fioslred throuph
mp mind. Percussit ie practically impersonal. The subject is latent
in the following words. sslco: literally‚ on tlte spot, i.e. irremedi-
otelp. The distinctly local meaning is also iound in Terence; ci.
Phorm. 194. attat. . . est: Ab! there ere hope it! h'ote the
quantity αιιᾶι. hoc illud=roir' ἐκεῖνο (Aristophanes, Ranae, 1342);
ci. Verg. Aen. 4. 675, Hoc illud, persuaso, suit? More numerous are
the cases where the idea in view is more iully defined, as Cio. ele
Senect. 20. 72, ltoo illud est quod Pisistrato tyranno a Solone respon·
sum est. Thus, similar to haec illast misericordia, is Verg. Aen.
3. 558, Nimirum haee illo Charybdis.

126. hinc lllae lacrumae: this expression, here used literally‚
became proverbial in the more general sense oi hoc illud est. Thus
Cicero, who is iond oi synonyme, follows up the phrase, in pro Unel.
25. 61, with et hoec consa est omnium scelerum5 ci. Hor. Epist. 1. 19.
41, where the poet explains why some critice ‹leory him.

127. quem timeo: quom alone with verbs is oommonest in con-
versatione! style. Cicero employs it not only in his letters (as Att.

’ 14. 15. 3, quum velim, and Αιι. 12. 20. 1), but occasionally in his
speeches, as Phil. 2, 8. 20, prtem td te non ‹lecehotl

128. procedit: the tense variatione in the verbs between procedit
and reiecit (136) are simply metri causo. sepulcrum here oi the

, place, not ot the burial, but oi the buming oi the body; ci. the similar
nse ot sepelio. Note the force securcd by brevity and asyndeton.
