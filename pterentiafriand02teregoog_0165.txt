officium). The narrative, as line 49 in‹lioatee,ls to be divided into
three parts, corresponding ιο Cicero's divisio tripartita oi a speech (de
Iaeeat. l. 23. 33), and thus we have the artati uitare, 51-1563 coa-
retransmeare, lat-lon qreid aelim, 168-170.

50. cognosces: ior variatione oi construction with the one verb,
ef. 210, 277, 515, 826.

51. nam: this use oi a oausal particle in beginning a narrative is
possibly due to a γάρ in the Greek original. 'l'ranslate by now or well
then. Cicero, de Orat. 2. 80. 326, givos this passage as an instance oi
lucid, even ii lengthy, narrative. excessit ex ephebia: cf. note
ou line 35. The same expression occurs iu Plautus, Mero. 61. When
eighteen years old, the Athenian youth was admitted among the ephebi
(mature youths), with whom he reurained till ho was twenty. During
these tvvo years he served in the militia as a περίπολος, but attha end
of this time he entered upon the ordinary occupatione oi manhood.
Here, however, the word ephebi may be used in a more general sense,
similar to adulescentes. So Horace, Epist. 2. l. lll. nam antea:
this nam gives the reason why Simo does not begin the narrative with
an earlier period; cretea only here in Terence, and nowhere in Plautus,
who uses crite, orttehac, and antidhac. On this line, see App.

⁵³. qui = qno modo, ci. band note. possem deliberative sub-
junctive.

54. dum: here and in Ean. 728 with the imperfect oi past con·
temporaneous action. The perfect is the common tense oi past time
in a dam-clauso in comedy. The historieal present does not occur
before Sallust. G. 569. note l. magister: i.e. the παιδαγωγός,
or slave who attended the boy to sehool. lt is interesting to contrast
the present use oi school-master and pealayoyae. Note the effective
asyndeton in enumeration.

5⁵. plerique omnes: almost all,· ci. Heaut. 830, aliar· pleraque
omnia,· Phorm. 172. That the expression was regarded as archaic in
the time oi Gellius, is seen from the heading oi one oi his lost chapters
(VIII. 12), Quid siyrtidcet e'a veterem libris scriptam “plerique omnee.''
adulescentuli: oar young sellows,· diminutive iorms, both ior sul>-
stantives and adjectivae, are very characteristic oi colloquial Latin.
So, too, they are very common in modern Italian.

⁵6. nt . . . adiungant: explanatory; Λ. dr G. 332. s; B. 297.
33 G. 6573 H. bil. 4. animum adiungere; used again in Hec.
683, and read by some in Iler. 690, devote alteration to rome saeorite
perrea. Terence also uses aeleram adpellere (Andr. prol. 13 446);

matum capitem (Andr. 193); animum adducere (Hec. 836).
