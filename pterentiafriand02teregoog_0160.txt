7. The iaetus poeto was Luscius Lanuvinus, a rival pleywright,
who did all iu his power to injure Terence. He attached the latter
chiefly because of his practice oi contantinoer’o. See line 16.

8. ultio dent: sc. poetae (dative). 'l'he subjectis the eritius.
For the final dative, see A.&G. 233; B. 191; G. 366 ; H. 433; Roby,
pref. Bk. ΙΙ. p. xxv. quaeso: often used parenthetically. Itis
from an earlier form, quoeseo, connected with quaero (¹quaiao), as
incesso with incedo.

9. The Andria reas so called because of the girl from Andros, one
of the Cyclades. similarly in the Perinthia, one ol the female ohar-
acters came from Perinthos in 'l'hrace

10. norit. . . nouerit: future-perfect forms. The line illustratas
Terence's use of the full and contracted forms in the perfect tenses, es
(eg.) onnam and -orom, -uuerom and -uram, -eueram and eram,
ducrum and nerum. The full forms he uses regularly at the close
of a line (cf. 494, 664, 613); the contractcd forms only ln the
middle (cf. 238, 341, 319, 620, 652, 914, 922, 934). with mono-
syllabic stema, however, the full form moy stand in the middle of
the line. So spreverit, Phorm. 5845 rroaeram, Eun. 778; lauerat,
Heaut. 618.

11. nonita: note this common use with an adiective, as in Cio.
Brut. 69. 244, nonita aridior. ln Cicero, noa ita valde, when a verb
follows; ci. de Nat. Deor. 1. 31. 66, reon ita valde moventur.

12. oratione ac etilo: according to Donatus, oratio od m
refertur, stilus od verho; oratio in sensa, stilus in verbm Arpa-
meatum is the main story, or plot ; oratio embraces the sentimenta
founded upon it; stilus is the tone or style. Cf. Pham. prol. ὃς
terrai cese oratione et scriptura leci, where scripturo correspondit to
stilus here. ln Plautus, stilus is always used litorally ol the pen—an
illustration of the much more extended use oi metaphor in Terence as
compared with Plautus.

14.. fatetur: sc. poeta. transtulisse: sc. aa. Thia omission
fs frequent in Terence3 cf. 1453 and see B. 314. 6; G. 627. 3. The
whole of the finit scene, according to Donatus, is based on the Perin-
teia. One criticism of Terence's art is that there ie too much mmi-
larity in his plois, and indeed in the very names of his characters
See Sellar, Roman Poeta os the Repuhlr'c. p. 216.

15. ld lati: for the scansion, see Introd. § 54. luti: Lethe
poet's critics; cf. iscormn, 21. ineo: tercia, or ia thie wantelen,
more commonly in ea re, as in 043 cf. 46. disputent: mainan,
originally calculata.
