transposing to 6611611116 1616. Black, leaving oh! with 615, makes
616 iambic by reading 6616 uicus.

618. 6161666611 following Dea, Spengel omits 61. All others
retain it.

625. 166166616161 no emendation of this line is necessary. See
Klotz, Altriimisohe 11611116, pp. 61, 78. The dactylic line 16 introduc·
tory to the cretic system. See Introd. § 74.

630. ia negando: Mss. and Don. have ia denegando (D inde
66661166). Spengel'e mode of correcting is the simplest, and we
accept his ia negando. So 1116611, now. The eompound 6616661616
(16616633, or is a reminiscente of 168. Most editors have 6666666111
modo, dueta Klette.

633. et timeat, etc: the thought is a repetition of 630 and cet,
and the line is therefore bracketed by most editore. However, it natu·

635-639. 1 give the lines, as arranged by Spengel (so Klotz,
Altriimiecbe Metrik, p. 407, and blech).

64⁷. aenae: Spengel, though retaining 1161166 16 238, reiecta it
here. So Fleok. and Meis, In the rest of the line both Dz. and
spen. (with 661 16166116) follow P C as Ι have given lt.

650. 6611116611.Ι Don. has preserved the reading, the Mss. all giving

word, for which 66116611, due perhaps to (114, 16 a prosaic substitute.

661. me essedariorum: Mea, but me ducturum, Don, and so most
editore. Spen. omitting me hae 6666 damarum. The form without

tetrameters‚ however, are inserted in the trimeter system without sui-
ficient reason, and Bentley rightly rejected 661166616 with the gloss
interturbat. Spengel further rejects mi.

665. socium est hoc: this, which 16 Bentley's reading (ee 6661116
antiquiores omnes), is also the reading of P (Warren). Other Mss.
have sactlwa 166 est, which is generally followed. For the repetition
Bentley also gave sociam est after the Peterhouse Codex. This makes
lt unneceaaary to insert 6 before scelus, aa do Spen. Dz. Fleek.

ing Bentley's vetustiores) except G, which hae ia quem me aoeepr'sti.
