451. drachmis: the Attio drachma, like the Roman denarius,
was a silver coin, equal to six obnls (see 369), and worth about twenty
cents oi our money. Greek words, involring such combinatione 01
consonante as ebm, cm, aba, cu, cl, and ma, suffered the insertion 01 a
vowel, when first introduced into Latin. So δραχμή and drachuma,
Ἀλκμήνη and Alcumena, τέχνη and techina, ὄχνη and adnue, Ἀσκλψ
riis and Aesculapius, μνᾶ and mina, etc. est obsonatus: ο1., icr

obsonari filiai nuptiis? and Stich. 681.

454. potissumum: Spengel takes this word as emphasizing quem
and is supported by Donatus, who makes it an adjective, referring ιο
rank (dignitate), as contrasted with aequalium, which refers ιο age

uuae, particularly iadau, my wedding-day, when 1 ought ιο invite all
my friends. quod dicendum hic siet: so sar as Ioupbt lo spealc
entre nous. The relative quod is here equivalent to quaad; bic, bere,

junctive in a restrictiva relative clause, as in quod scium. A. lt G.

455. perparce nimium: very sparluply, tao mucb so. Some
editors take this as a tmesis ior pernimium parce, but such a tmesis
seems to be confined ιο cases where an enclitic or ejaculation (eg.
mibi, bercia) intervenes between per and the adverb. See 486.
