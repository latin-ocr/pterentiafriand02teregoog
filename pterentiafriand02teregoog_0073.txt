opening narrative, in which is set forth the position of affairs
at the outset of the play.

Scenes into which a musical clement entered were of two
kinds. They were either (u) declaimed in recitative style,
with flute accompaniment, or (b) they were actually sung to
set tunes. Both ol these kinds ol soenes were known as
cantica The former (u) were composed either in lambio
octonarii, or in trochaic or iambic septenarii. 'Phe latter
(b) were distinctly lyrical soenes, composed in a variety of
metros, including not only the more unusual once, such as
the cretic, bacchiac, and trochaic octonarii, but also those
mentioned in connection with (a) the merely recited
cantica.¹ Livius Andronicus introduced the custom of
having these lyrical cantica sung by ayoung slave, who stood
near the flute-player, while the actor merely gesticulated in
a suitable manner. This singer was probably the cantor,
who pronounced the plaudite at the close of the play, and is
referred to in the well-known lines of Horace : -

Sl plausoris eges aulaea manentis et usque
Sessuri donec cantor ‘Vos plaudite’ dicat. (Ara Poet. 154-155.)2

weighty air and accord with the professional tone assumed
by Lesbia The soliloquy of Charinus (625 ff.) opens with
a dactylic line, which suggests a dignified sels-restraint, but
this speedily gives way to a passionate outburst of feeling,
well expressed in the broken rhythm ol the suooecding
cretics (626-634). ,
