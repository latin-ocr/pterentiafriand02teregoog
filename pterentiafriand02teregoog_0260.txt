The latter is ionnd also in Μ and Don. Butae Faernus argues, the
explanation in Don. (omnio mihi inteyro et seluo redde, qualia tibi
tradidi consulturo) would indicate that his reading was really restitue
locam. Schlee (p. 4) maintains that G gives the original reading,
which was altered hythe aanor librorum PC, and afterwards etiam
in arctiqaiaaimum D irrepsit. This is very improbable. All that G
can mean is, ‘restore the position into which you received me,‘ which
ia really the opposite oi what is intended, viz. ‘restore me to my
former position, which yon altered) Fleck. reads restitue me in quem
acceptati lacurn, but a comparison oi Phorm. 33, nohis restituit locam,
confirmo our choice.

682. Mas. give socient. Atiam hoc opus eat. Hem, aed mane,
concrepuita Glycerio ostium. In G α Glycerio is wanting. Bent.
dropa henr and mone and inserts hinc aiter verb. So Da, though
retaining item. Umpi. drops con· (so Meis), Fleck. both aed and con.
Spen. cnts the line down to a trimeter by dropping opus est and
α Glycerio. Wagner reads ab istoc, treating Glycerio as a gloss. This
is the eesieat emendation. Hem and moneare both giren by Don.
Ostium concrepuit or soree crepuerunt ie the regular expression, and
ab with a pronoun is commonly added; ci. Ean. 1021), Phonn. 840,
Heaut. 173, Her. eal.

606. ehem: so Bent. ior Mas. hem, and accepted by Meis Dz.
Fleck.

quid id est: the id omitted by Mea. Fleck. now reads quidnam eet.
Schlee (Wdlffiin's Archiv, vol. ΙΙΙ, p. 555) retains qnid est, taking
the line as an octonarius and scanning milri.

691. potia erot: 1 have adopted Engelbrecht's conjecture (Stadia
Terent, p. 28) ior the Mas. potuerat. In Eun. 113, where all Mss.
including Α have potuerat, Bentley's conjecture potia erat is generally
accepted.

712. hnc soc ed: the Mes. show soce and so Umpi. Meis. spen,
but elsewhere fuce is found only at the end oi a verse. Fac occurs
fifteen times beiore vowels; ci. 408, 483. Here, therefore, Engel·
breclrt is right in restoring soc with Schubert.

rna neniae: so P C and “du-o en nostris vetustissimi” (Bent.). So
Bent and Speu. 3 other lise. and editors nt uenies.

71³. Du.1iye,ueniom. Cn. siquid: so Mes. Spengel (so Da.
and Fleck.) prefers to give ri qnid to Davus, who thus mocks Charinus.
llowever, the repetition in the mouth oi Charinus is also effective, and
1 therefore adhere to the traditional reading.

728. inronrlrirnst: almost all editors accept Bentley’s conjecture
