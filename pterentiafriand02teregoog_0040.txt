Scipionis circle were to be seen the finest products of that
Hellenic civilization which, by the end of the second Punic
war, had made an almost complete conquest of Roman
society:—

Graecia capta lerum victorem cepit (Hor. apat. 2. 1. 156). ·

The Hellenizing of Rome, as Mommsen has graphically
shown,¹ carried with it a host of evils; but it was not those
citizens who were thoroughly steeped in Greek thought, and
who, in their refined tastes, their lore of learning, and their
literary pursuits, shewed the fairest fruits of Greek culture,
at whose door could be laid the charge of corrupting a
nation. On the contrary, these were the men who set
themselves the task of improving the public taste and
thereby improving the public morals; and that this result
was actually accomplished is probably illustrated best by
the history of the plays of Terence, which, emanating from
this select group of Hellenists, faithfully reflected the re·
fined thought and elegant style of the most polished Greek
of later days. At first coldly received by the public, they
gradually won their way into popular favor, and, in a quar·
ter of a century after Terence’s death, completely supplanted
the plays of the coarser, more farcical, more animated, more
Roman, but less artistic, Plautus.

The Andria, Terence's earliest play, was exhibited in
166 no. In connection with it is told the interesting story
to which we have already referred. The author offered his
play to the aediles, who directed him to take it tc Caecilius
for approval. The young poet presented himself to his
censor when the latter was at dinner. Being meanly clad,
he was told to sit down on a bench, but after reading a few
lines was invited to share the conch of Caecilius, who listened
to the rest of the play with profound admiration.
