ACT 1. SCENE l.

Simo appears vvlth his ireedman Sosia, followed by two slaves, who
are carrying the provisions bought in the marhot. The old Mss. illus·
tratione show flsh, iowl, vegetables, and coolringutensils. On this
opening soene, see Introd. ς 36.

28. iatam: the supplies just purchased.

29. adesdum: come ltere itero. The ictus corresponds with the
word-accent, as here dnm is not a separate word, but an enclitic. This
dnm, originally temporal iu ioroe (= “a vvhile,'’ “a bit’'), being an
accusative singular neuter irom a nominal or pronominal stem, and
identical vvith the conjunctioni (liam, is used ireely with imperatives in

early Latin, and survives iu later Latin in opedam, agitedum, as well
as nondum, nodata, etc. See Lindsay, Lot. Lonp. p. 609. paucis
te uolo: ior the ablative paucis, cf. Eun. 1067, audite poncia, etc.
Here the ablativo modifles a verb understood, eg. appellare (ci. Plaut.

Aul. lae, paucis te volo appellare) or veriloqui (cf. Plaut. Men. 431,
benevolo conloqui). dictum puta: reponi it as soid; equivalent
to tenco, Ι inmorata-nd, you need say ero more.

³0. nempe ut: so. vis. curentur: looked after, ie. coolced, =
coquantur (Don.).

³1. ara: cookep took high rank as an art in the degenerata days
oi the Middle and New Attio comedy. ‘⁶ lt was uo mere trade, but a
natural gift, a special art, a school oi higher philosophy” (Mahaily,
Sociol Life in Graece, p. 209).

³2. istac: as demonstrative oi the second person, corresponds to
meo oi the previous liue.

33. eia: sc. ortibus, iu the sense oi virtues. So used by Plautus,
Cicero, Horace, etc.; ci. Hor. Carni. 4. 15. 12.

35. For ego to open a narrative, ci. 330, 582, eto. lt makes an
emphatic beginning (pronis inceptio orationis, Dou.). a paruolo:
from boybood. So o parvalis, Caes. B. tt. t. 21 ; o parvis, Andr. 530;
a pueris parvolis, Adel. 494; ea pueris occessit, Cic. pro Archia, 3. 4.
The Latin idiom is frequently concrete where the English is abstract3
ci. ea mito, 37. ut . . . iusta et clemens tuerit: bow equitabit
aad easy it hoa been. To secure the assistance oi Sosia, Simo reminds
him oi the favore conferred upon blm.

36. apiid me: unte the ictus. The personal pronouns, unless
emphatic, are unaccented. Apud me makes a word group, a sort oi
compound word. So in Plautus always vae ntiaero mibi. See Introd
