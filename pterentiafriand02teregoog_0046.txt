all good cornedy must conform to one type, we may claim
for Terence that in the refined cornedy of daily life, the
cornedy of manners, he possessos certain excellences quite
foreign to Plautus, in some of which no later dramatist has
ever been found superior.

The quality in which Terence mainly excels is his artistic ·
finiam—the quality recognized by the critios of Horace's
day as his distinguishing feature,¹-which is the more
remarkable when we consider how many years lie between
him and the polished writers of the Augustan age. For
a Roman writer of the second century nc. to conceive a
high ideal of literary art in connection with a sphere of

writer to realize perfection in artistic form is evidence of
no little genius. The purity ot his style commended him
to the most fastidious critice oi Rome. Cicero, who often
quotes him in his essays and speeches, and otherwise fur·
nishes plentiiul evidence oi his influence,² gives happy
expression to his admiration ior this virtue, as well as for
his moderatiori of tone aud agreeable charin of diction, in
