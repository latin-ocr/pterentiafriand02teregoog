(3) Verbs of the fourth conjugation, including aio, have
ibam as well as -iebam in the imperfect indicative, and -ibo
(ibor), as well as -iarn (101), in the future3 ci. servibas (38),
comperiebam (90), aibat (932), aiebat (930), aibant (534). In
the Andria, Terence always employa the regular future forma,
but scibo (scibis, scibit) and seruibo, opperitur, 11111 experibere,
all occur in other plays.

(4) Syncopated forms are common in the second person
singular perfect indicative, eg. dixti (518, 593, 621, 852; in
459 dixisti is probably correct), inducti (572, 883), intellecti
(201, 500, 506), amsii (882), praescripsti (151). In the per-
fect infinitire, syncopated forins are rare, the only instances
being produce, Ac. 5613 decesse, Heuut. 323 111111, Hecut.
1001.

(5) The imperative succ is found only at the end 01 1
verse, eg. 680, 821, 833 (see critical note cn 712), else-

always 11 the end 01 1 verse, deludier (203), inmutarier (275),
adipiscier (332), claudier (573).

(7) The forms siem, siet, sieut, for sim, sit, sint, occur
frequently, but only at the end of a verse or a half-verse,
before the caesura5 cf. 234, 288, 390, etc. Similarly possiet
(874).

(8) Prosent subjunctive forms in -111 belong only 1ο the
end of a verse. So duint (666).

(9) The forms fauo 101 ⁸fecero, and saarim for fecerim are
common3 cf. 753, 854. With this 11101011110111)1 two per-
fect subjunctive forms in -sirn are Terentian, viz. 11111111
(760), and appeltassis (Phoron. 712). This is in marked con-
trast with Plautus, who uses a large number 01 both futures
and subjunctives of this kind.

(10) In Terence, as in Plautus, es, the second person
singular indicative 01 1111, 11 always a long syllable. Both
