works of Cratinus and Eupolis, nothing remains beyond
scanty fragments, but the great Aristophanes (444-388 ne.)
is represented by eleven extant plays.

In cornio power, the genius of Aristophanes has never
been surpassed. His fancy, rioting at will, turns everything
topsy-turvy. His choristers assume the parts of plumaged

the Great (336 ac), and includes two plays of Aristophanes,
the Ecclesiazosoe and the Plutus. This species serves asa
