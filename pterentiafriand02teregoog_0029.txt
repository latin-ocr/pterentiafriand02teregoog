lus and the chdias, of which the originale are unknown
Only a few lines of these plays survive, but they are
enough to show that in his dramas Livius employed Greek
iambic‚ trochaic, and cretio mensures. In his earlier work,
atranslation of the Odyssey, which was used in the schools
of Rome as late as Horace's boyhood,¹ Livius had essayed ’
the native Saturnian measure, hut itis evident that he now
regarded this as quite inadequate for his purpose. Cicero¹
declares that the plays of Livius are not worthy of a second
reading. The old dramatist, however, should be respected
aethe one who paved the wey for Ennius and first set
Roman literature on the path it so long followed In his
own day he was very highly esteemed. In 207 no, he was
commissioned by the state to compose a hymn of interces-
sion to June,⁸ and it was due to him that poets (scribae
histrionesque) for the first time received public recognition,
being allowed to form a guild and hold meetings in the
temple of Minerva on the Aventina.

πᾶ The comedies which Roman writers, following the
example of Livius, took from Greek sources are known
either as comoediae or as fabulae palliatae, from the Greek
palliam worn by the actors.⁴ This species flourished for
nearly a century. Its earlier representatives treated the
Greek originale with great freedom, and made many con-
cessions to popular teste, while the later writers took pride
in adhering more closely to the models chosen, and iu faith-
fully reproduciug their refinement of tone, elegance of style,
and artistic consisteucy.

⁴Similarly, comedies in which the soenes and personages were
Roman, were styled togatae, or later tabernariae (irorn taberna, a
shop), because oi their more vulgar tone. The togatae, however,
belong to the century alter Livius, and their best representatives
ere Τ. Quinctius Atta and L. Afranius.
