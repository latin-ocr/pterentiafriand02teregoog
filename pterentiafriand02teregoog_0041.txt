THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROMAN'COMEDY. XXXV

The Hecyra, first produced in 165 ne, was poorly received,
aud did not meet with success until its third presentaticn,
in 160 nc. The Heauton Timcrumence, cr dds-formentur,
was first performed in 163 e.c.; the Eurruclrue and Plrcrrur'o
belong to 161, and the Adelplroe to 160. In this last year
Terence went to Greecc, probably with the intention of
gaining further insight into the Greek life which was
depicted in his plays. In Grcece hc made translations cf
a number of Menandcr's plays, but in 159 no. died, while
on the point of returning home. The cause cf his untimely
death is uncertain. Thcugh Porcius Licinus says he died
penniless, yet another account tells us that he left twenty
acres of gardana on the Appian Way, and that his daughter
married a Roman knight. In appearance Terence is said to
hare been mediocri statura, gracili corpore, colore susce.

With two exceptions- the Hecyra and the Phemio—the
plays of Terence are based on comedies by Menander. In
adapting these, the Latin dramatist aimed at an artistic

ground, is to bc excluded from asphere into which, by the
rules of art, it can claim no right of admissicn. A play ol
Terence, therefore, notwithstanding the purity of its Latin
style, is but a Greek play written in Latin. Its title is
Greek, and it portrays the life, not cf contemporary Rome,
but of Athens a century and a half earlier. Such reflectione
of distinctly Roman thought and manners as arc to be found
occasionally in Terence, are obviously due to an unconscious
departure from his rule.¹

Yet it would bc unjust tc Terence tc suppose that his
plays are merc translations. Rather, they are adaptatione,
