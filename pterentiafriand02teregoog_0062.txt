had to sit on the bare ground. The level space between
the coneo and the proscaenium was reserved 161 officials,
senators, and other people of distinction. In 179 ac, a
small stage of stone was erected near the temple 61 Apollo,
presumably for use in the ludi Apollinares ,· hut though public
interest in the drama was now increasing, so that in 174 nc.
the censors allowed the rnaintenance 61 a stage to be a
charge on state fuuds, yet in 155 no, shortly after the death
61 Terence, we find that the senate, following the advice ο1
P. Scipio Nasica, prolribited the building of a permanent
stage. But this victory for the old conservative spirit of
Rome was shortlived. ln 145 ac. Mummius, in celebrating
his conquest of Graece, had plays performed in a complete
theatre, provided not only with stage-platform and walls,
but also with seats in the regular auditorium. Even this
structure was made only of wood, and was torn down after
the celebration. Tho first permanent theatre in Rome was
not erected until nearly a century later, when in 55 ao. the
stone theatre of Cn. Pompeius was dedicated,¹—a building
capable, itis said, of accommodating forty thousand specta-
tors² (Pliny, N. H. 36. 115). The famous theatre of Marcel-
lus, of which imposing ruins still remain, was built in 13 ac.

simple. Artistic decorations 161 1116 stage were introduced
in the aedileship 61 Claudius Pulcher (99 nc), and not
before 79 Bo. was there a shifting 61 1116 soenes. The scene
in a Terentian play is invariably a street in Athens, show-
ing three houses. In the And-rio, the centre house is Simo's,

The side-walls did not extend as far as the scaena, and so
