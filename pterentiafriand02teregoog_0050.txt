Simo, pretending that there is uo obstacle to the marriage
between his son aud Philumena, orders Pamphilus to make
ready for au immediate wedding. His main objectis to
secure a good reason for reproviug his son, should the latter
refuse. At the same time, iu case Pamphilus should acqui·
esce in his wishes, he hopes to prevail upon Chremes to give
his consent. Pamphilus is, of course, inclined to disobey,

approach, and cleverly pretending to regard heras the agent .
of villanous impostore, makes her declare iu the old geu·
tleman’s hearing that the baby belongs to Pamphilus.

Chremes is convinced‚ and by again renounciug the match
