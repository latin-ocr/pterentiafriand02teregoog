68 The proceleusmatic is not allowed by Terence as a
substitute for the trochee, Lo. Otherwise, any of the sub
stitutes allowed for the iambus in iambic verse may be ern·
plcyed in trochaic as well, the metrical ictus, however, being
always upon the first syllable of the foot.

69. Trcchsic septenarius (Tetrsmeter Camertic), contain-
ing seven complete feet, aud one that is incomplete. This,
next to the iambis senarius, is the commonest metro in
Terence (212 lines in the Andria). Diaeresis generally
occurs after the fourth foot, which cannot then be a dactyl.
Sometimes the diaeresis comes at the end of the fifth foct,
accompanied by another after the third, or by a caesura in
the third The seventh foot is usually a pure trochee, but
is sometimes a tribrach. Lines 259 and 260 are thus
scanned:—

Aliquid facerem, ut hdc ne facerem. ssd nunc quid primum exsequar?
Tdt ms inpediunt odrae, quae meum animum divorsae trahunt.

⁷0. ircchsic Octonsrius (Tetrameter Acatslcctlc).—This
isa rare measure in Terence, only four such lines occurring
in the Andria, viz. 245, 247, 301, 305. Substituticns are
frcely allowed, even in the eighth foot. Diaeresis is usually
found after the fourth loot, which in that ease must not
be a dactyl. Sometimes however, a caesura occurs in the
fourth or fifth foct instead. The verse is employed by
Terence only in alternation with others. The scansion of
245 is as follows: —

Adeon hominem esse invenustum aut infelicem quemquam, ut ego
sum !
