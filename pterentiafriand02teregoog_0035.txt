Dicitur . . .
Plautus ad exemplar Siculi properare Epicharmi. (Epist. 2. 1. 58.)

Here, in his rapidity of movemeut (the precise force is
doubtful), Plautus is said to have taken Epicharmus as a
model. There is no reason to doubt this statement, but wc
may also bear in mind that Epicharmus, with all his refine
ment, vvas the representative of a dramatis field—Sicilian

¹ comedy-which was “essentially burlesque.''1 being the
direct outgrowth of the rude Dorio fruces,² If we are cor·
rectin assuming the presence ofa large native clement
in Plautino comedy, it would be but natural that his playa,
quite apart from any consciens imitation, should in certain
respecta resemble the comedies of Epicharmus.

One side of Plautus—the coarse, bautcring jests, indeo
orous demeanor, and apparent disregard for common moral-
ity which many oi his plays exhibit-is best explained by
the merry ubcudoo and unrestraiued spirit of revelry which
characterized the rustic festivals of the Romans, We have
already noticed³ the Fescennino licentia, which Horace tells
us was so prominent a feature of these festivals, and which
was thought especially appropriate on the occasion of wed-
dings. The introduction of this clement was sanctioned—if
any sanction vvere needed-by the precedent oi Aristoph-
anes, in whose plays the Dionysiae revels explain much that
is offensive to modern tastc.⁴
