(6) In the fifth declension, fidei (dat.) is dissyllabis, as in
296, but the spelling fide, which is often adopted, is doubt·
ful. So too spel (gen.) as in 25, and rel (dat.) as in 458, both
monosyllabic. On the other hand, rei (gen.) in 457, is a
dissyllable, similar to el (dat. of is) in 413.

r'sta, estred, and ille, illa, illud, the forms r'atie, r’staec, r'stua, and
fllia, illaec, illuc, are common. The pronoun hia has a variety
of forms. The nominative plural masculine is either 7ιί or
hisce (Euo. 269). The nominativeplural feminine is either
hae or baec, the former only before consonante, the latter
before vowels or consonants. Iu tho genitive singular, the
genitive, dative, and ablativa plural, and the accusative
plural, masculine and feminine, forms with or without -e, ee
are used, the former only before vowels and h, the latter
only before consonants. The interrogative pronoun, quoius,
-a, am, occurs in 763, 772, and 932.

(8) Pote and potis are both in use, the former before con·
sonants only (ef. Plrorm. 535), the latter before substantive
verb forms which begin with avowel. Necesse is used be
fore novale, and neceam before consonante (cf. 372).

and aornpem'ar (962) are used. In some verba, both the active ,
and deponent forms are in use. Thus, conparare and -arf
(cf. 93 and Phorra. 565), impertire and impertiri (Ean. 271
aud Aa. 320), obsonare and obsonari (Andr. 451 and Aa. 117).
