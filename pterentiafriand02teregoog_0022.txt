19. The germ of Attio comedy is found in the Dionysiae
comus, the merry processiones mammem, wb0, to the music
cf the flute, sang and danced in honor cf the god. The word
comedy signifies the corrurasoay, and was, nc doubt, coined at

Athens on the analogy oi tragedy ; but comedy proper did
not exist until to the masquerading comus was added an
autor. It is this actor who brings into anion the Attio
Comus and the Doric Farce, and offers a satisfactory expla-
nation of the tradition that a Megarian, one susanna,
invented Attic comedy.l

20. Comedy was first recognized officially at Athens in
465 n.c.; and as tragedy had been, for years before, a state
function, it is natural that comedy should have been sorne-
what assimilated in form to tragedy. However, there re
mained great differences between the tw0, and the structure
of Old comedy, es exemplified by its famous representative
Aristophanes, was too unique to serve as a permanent frame-
work lor comedy. Resides the chorus, twice as large as in
tragedy, and therefore favorable to a division into rival
semichoruscs, there was regularly an cyon, or contest, in
which the actors engaged as disputante on some subject of
real or fictitious importancc. In addition to the cyon, there
was the parubcsr's, which was not unlike the Terentiae pro
logue, and in which the chorus-leader, addressing the audi-
ence in the name of the poet, sets forth his views on literar-y
questions, or on matters of public interest. As a rule, the
plot comes practically to an end when the parabcsis is
reached, and the rest of the play consists of a series cf
looscly connected soenes.

21. The most flourishing period of the Old Comedy was
that of the Peloponnesian War (431-404 no). Of the

lh briei but very scholarly account ci early Greek comedy is glven
by Barnett in Tbe Greek Dromo (The Temple Primers, Macmillan‚
1899). The illustratione given on p. 51 show that the earliest actors
in Attio comedy resemble the clowns of Rhinthcn's iarccs.
