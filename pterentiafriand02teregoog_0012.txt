Like the modern Italian, the Roman was gifted with
quickness of wit, great versatility, and vivid mimetic powers.
, In common with other nations, the early Latius celebrated
festivals which were marked by dance and song. It is a
familiar fact that the Greek drama sprang from the songs
and dances which attended the worship of the god Diony-
sus, who in spring-time filled all nature with renewed life.
similarly, in Latium, besides the great annual festival of
victory, which in time carne to be known as the Ludi
Romani, there were frequent celebrations in honor of the
rustic gods, a partia] enumeration of which will indicate
how largely they entered into the life of these primitive
people. Thus we have the Ambarvalia, Cerealia, Compitalia,
Consualia, Faunalia, Floralia, Fontinalia, Fornacalia, Libe·
ralia, Lupercalia, Meditrinalia, Opalia, Paganalia, Palilia,
Robigalia, Saturnalia, Terminalia, Vinalia, and Volcanalia.¹
4. ln what manner these festivals were celebrated may
be gathered from many passages in Latin writers. Thus,
a rustic procession with (lance and song is mentioned in
connection with the rites ol Ceres:-

Terque novas circum felix eat hostia fruges,
Omnis quam chorus et socii comitentur ovantes,
Et Cererem clamore vocent in tecta; neque ante
Falcem maturis quisquam supponat aristis,
Quam Cereri torta redimitus tempora quercu
Det motus incompositos et carmina dicat.
(Verg. Georp. 134511.)

And again, after describing the Attio Dionysia, Vergil tells
us how the ancient Latius honored Bacchus:—

Versibus incomptis ludunt risuque soluto,
Oraque corticibus sumunt horrenda cavatis,
Et te, Bacche, vocant per carmina laeta, tibique

Oscilla ex alta suspendunt mollia pinu.
(Ceorp. 2. 386 fl.)
