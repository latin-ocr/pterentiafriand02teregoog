ishad by one-half and its functions are limited ; the scenio
accessor-ies are curtailed; the parabatis is thrown out; the
audacity of personal and politica] satire begins to disappear,
and caricatures of literary, philosophie, and social lise become
prominent. Burlesqnes on mythology show that Middle
Comedy and Epicharmus had much in common. The names
of over forty poets oi this school survive, but only scanty
fragments of their work. Of these writers, Alexis and
Antiphanes are the best known, as many as two hundred
and fovty-five plays being attributed to the former, and even
more than this number to the latter. ι

23. The periodos Ncw comedy covers nearly a century,
from 336 rac. to 250 rac, -a period when the Atheniens had
quite lost their old-tirno valor and patriotic spirit, though
they were still a shrewd, wideawake, and intellectus] peo
ple. The love of pleasure was the main principle of life3 ,
the Epicurean philosophy, so easily misunderstood and mis·
applied, was fashionable; a pagan cynicism and unbelief
were prevalent3 and all of these phascs of life are reflected
in the literature of the day.

Comedy has now almost lost the chorus, which comes to
be regarded as an alien clement and is practically limited in
its functione to danciug and the singing of interludes. The
prologue, which earlier signified all the play preceding the
entrance of the chorus, now follows the example set by
Euripides, and consists of a speech lying completely out
side of the dramatic action. The parabatis has entirely
disappeared, and the upon can no longer be clearly recog·
nized. Furthcr, the extravagant and audacioris tone of
earlier comedy has given way to refinement of thought
and simplicity of style. Grotesque caricature and broad
farce are no longer in keeping with the dignity oi the
art. Above all, instead of the inere succession of looscly
connected soenes, we now lind a carefirlly constructed
plot.
