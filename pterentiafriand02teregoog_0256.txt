¹ 507-9. llere the preceding catalectic verse suggests a metrical
change, but the lines have caused much trouble. Editors generally
take them as iambic. Dz. (ey.) gives them thus :—

Sed nilo setius mox puerum huc deferent ante ostium
Id ego ianr nunc tibi, ere, renuntio futurum, ut sfs sciens,
Ne tu hoc posterius dicas Daui factum consilio aut dolis.

It happens that our sources show not a little uncertainty here and
there. In 507 Mss. have piverum deserent buo, but Eugr. deserent buc
puerum, and moa is found only in Don. and in one of the two read·
ings in B Ε. sed (set) would be an easy insertion, perhaps influenced
by setius, and Fleck. is probably right in reading the trochaic line,

nihilo setius mox puerum huc deferent ante ostium.

In 508 the erere naati(o) oi O (bere naratio, B) suggests that the
compound renuntio rnay be due ιο dittography, helped by rementia-
tumst (501). I) G, lb A XII, and Don. have the order renuntio ere,
but since Bentley most editors give ere renuntio, which order is neces-
sary if the line is taken as iambic. Spengel gives theline thus, but
with iarn auae after renuntio-an uncalled-fcr change. If necatio is
considered too uncertain, the reading ιο be adopted is that given by
'Fleck.: -

fd ego ianr nunc tibi renuntio, ere, futurum, ut sis sciens.

This is the reading of the Delphin edition and Stallbaum, but in these
editions the line was treated as iambic (tibi).

For 509 bles. have ae ta boo mibi (inibi hoc, D G) posterius dicus
Daui, etc. It is clear that both aiibi and Daui cannot stand. Bent-
ley, who has been generally followed, struck out mibi. The allitera·
tion involved is certainly in favor of dicus Daui. Fleck, therefore,
omitting ta as well ascribi, gives the trochaic line :-

ne hoc posterius dfcas Daui facturn consilio avit dolis.

But Skutsch (Hermes, vol. XXXII, 1897, pp. 93-94) shows that this is
one of the passages in Terence where the form poste should be restored.
Skutsch, however, falls to see that the line should be trochaic, and
therefore keeps mibi, which he claims is an important word. With
this I cannot agree. We satisfy all necessary conditione if we read ε -

ne tu hoo poste dfcas Daui factum consilio aut dolis.

The broken rhytlnn accords with the satirical and hypocritical tone
oi Davus.
