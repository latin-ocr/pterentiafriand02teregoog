comedy, and secure greater complexity of plot. It is obvi·
ous, however, that contaminatio could be employed only in
the case of originale with similar plots. Terence admits
that he has employed contaminatio iu connection with the
Andria, Ercoriobris, and Adeipboe. In the case of the Adit
phoa, the two plays drawn upon are by different poets,
Menander and Diphilus. The Hecyra is perhaps similar, iu
having a portion of Menander’s Έπιτρέποντες engrafted upon
the Ἐκυρά oi Apollodorus.1

Our knowledge of Terence’s practice of corriarninatio is
gained from the prologues to his plays. These prologues
hear considerable resemblance to the porciones of Old
Comedy.² The latter, it is true, found a place in the body
of the play,⁸ while Terence’s prologue lies completely out-

side of the play proper. Iu both casea, however, the speaker

addresses the audience in the name of the poet, just as is
done in the modern prologue. The subject-matter of the old
parabasea, as is to be expected, is more varied theu that of
the Terentian prologue, for the former deal with topics of
both public and private interest, while Terence limits him-
self to a discussion of hostile criticisrn or of circumstances
attending the representation oi his plays. The prologues
to the Hecyra explain the previous failures of that play, hut
all the other prologues deal mainly with the strong opposi-
tion enconntered by the young poet. It is evident that
Terence was looked upon as en innovator, who was dis·
regarding the canons set up by a school⁴ of criticism of
which Luscius Lanuvinus was the chief representative.
