xxx ' INTRODUCTION.

The persona] and political chose, which in the Old Comedy
naturally acoompanies its grossness, we need not expect to
find in Plautus. The apparent absence of strong convictione
in politics or anything else on the author’s part sufficiently
‘accounts for this; but even if it had been otherwise, the fate
of Naevius would probably have deterred his younger corr-
temporary from following in his footsteps. Plautus, how-
ever, may show the direct influence of Old Conredy in his
occasions] allusione tc current events, in the frequent asides
addressed to the audience, aud especially in the parcensis
which marks the Cirrcrlic. The tragicocomoediu Amphitruo
probably belongs to the sphera of Sicilian Comedy.¹

It is claimed by Sellar that “in the large place assigned
to the ‘Cantica' which were accompanied by music and
gesticulation,” the Plautino plays show considerable traces
of the indigenous Saturne. Doubtless, these exerted some
influence, but it is highly probable that the contr‘cu arethe sur·
riving forrn of the old choral songs, which embodied the
original lyric clement in Greek conredy. With the loss of
the chorus, this clement, instead of being concentrated as
before, becomes more or less soattered through the dialogue.
A large portion of a play of Plautus or Terence was actually
sung, or at least accompanied by music, and in Plautus the
more reflective passages, especially in soliloquy-form, are
presented iu a variety of distinetly lyrica] metres. The
labored style, which often characterizes these in contrast
with the easy flow of the dialogue,.is probably due to the
difficulty of adapting the thought to the Greek form. Ter-
ence, after one experiment, wisely abandoned the more
elaborate lyrical measures2

The dialogue cf Plautus is rich, full, and spontaneous in
