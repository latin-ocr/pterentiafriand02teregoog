. Mssuscsrsrs.

The principel Mss. of Terence are the following :-

A. Demoleos, now in the Vaticau library in Rome. Ιι is oi the
fourth or fifth century, and is written in rustic capitals. Though
the oldest and most important of the Mes, it is available for less than
one hundred lines of the Andria, viz. 888 to end. Only a few letters
survive to represent lines 787-887. The earlier part of the play is
completely lost. The order of the plays is Andr, Eun, Heaut,
Plorm, Hoc, Aa.

The remaining Mss. are written in minuscule characters and may
be divided into three groups‚ those which show close kinship to one
another being classed 'together under γ or t. The third, or mixed
group (μ), includes those which cannot be classifled so easily.

Gnour γ.

Ρ. Parisioue,nowinthe Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. lt is of
the nlnth or tenth century, is finely illustrated, and preserves the
metres. The order of the plays is mainly chronological, viz. Andr,
Eun„ Heaut, Ad, Hoc, Phoron. See Introd. p. li, note 3. Lines
804-853 of the Andria were originally omitted, but have been supplied
by a different haud.
