his life comes mainly from Donatus, who in his commentary
on Terence gives an extract from the lost work of Suetonius,
De Viris Illustriboa.l The year of his birth is uncertain.
Terence is said to have been in his twenty-fifth year, when,
in160 mc, he set out for Greece. This would make 185 rac.²
the year of his birth, and this accords with the statement
that Scipio, who was also born in that year, was Terencc’s
capreolis. To this date it is objected that ii Caecilius died,
as Jerome tells us, the year after Ennius, ie. in 168 nc,
the story of Terence's reading his Acadira to the old play-
wright would make Terence out as amarvellously precocious
youth However, either derome’s statement may bc incor-
rect³ or the story of Terence and Caecilius apocryphal.⁴

A Carthaginien by birth, Terence was taken as a slave³ to
Rome, and there educated in the house of Terentius Lucanus,
who gave him his freedom. The source of his praenomen is
unknown, but his nomeu comen, according to the custom,
from his patron’s gentile name, while his cognomen indicates
his native country. His personal beauty, intellectuel gifts,
and probably the interest attaching to his foreign birth,
recommended him to the circle of Scipio Africanus the
Younger, with whom he became very intimate. Among his
friends were also included older men of literary attainments
and official rank, such as 0. Sulpicius GalluS, Q. Fabius
Labeo, aud M. Popilius.

The coterie into which Terence was admitted belonged to
the most refiued and intellectual society of Rome. In the

Suetonius (Leipzig, laec), p. 26.

Phormio, p. la, note 2.
