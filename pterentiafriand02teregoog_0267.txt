aas dliqecis, proposed by Podiaski (Quomodo Terentiae in Tetrometris
iambiciset T rochaiois Verborum Aoceatus cum Numerio Ooasooiaoerlt,
p. 14). Fleck. also transposes prouiso from its place at the beginning
of the line to that efter Pamphilus, thus making the line troehaia In
this we need not follow him.

9⁵9. eapropter: so Servius here (on Verg. Ecl. 7. 31). By adopt·
ing it for propterea (hies.) Bentley brought harmony out of dlsoord.
Umpf. preferred to keep propterea and change deorum into deam, but
the latter form is used by Terence only in such formulae as (eg.) pro
deam sidera So Engelbrscht, Stadia Terent, p. 18.

963. mallem: thus A, accepted by Bent. Umpf. and Fleok. All
others give mallia. The imperfect seems preferable, in view of optent.
The latter is used while Pamphilus is still pondering on the matter.
Davus appears before he has made up his mind, aud mollem, therefore,
has reference to what might hare been.

965. There is no new scene indicated bere in Α or the Mes. of the
ygroup. Probably the omission is originally due to the necessity of
economizing space, as the play draws 10 a close.

ODoue: Fleck. greatly improves the line by inserting the interjec-
tion, which thus throws the ictus 01 the second foot on the first sylla·
ble oi ubi. These interjections are commonly omitted or inserted in
the hiss. In this verse (eg.) o is omitted by γ before Pamphile,
while in 974 all Mss. wrongly insert it before Charine.

967. sim: Mes. and Don. So Bent. Umpf. Spen. Dz. West
Other editors, including Fleck, read sam, 1 keep the subjunctive,
which involves a slight reproach to Pamphilus, who falls to realize
Davus’ misfortune as vividly as his own good luck.

969. Glyceram osea : thus A, and rightly preferred by most editors
to the 0110 Glycerium of the other Mss. Note the ictus.

9⁷1. See Troas. os the Amor. Phil. Asson, vol. XXX (1899), p. 12.

973. collucet: hies, followed by Umpf. and Wag. The second
person, es, is read by Bent. (duo et nostris cram veter. ed), also Meis.
Spen. Dz. and now Fleck. There is not sufficient resson for depart-
ing from the reading 01 the Mes. It is true that a Greek proverb ran ε
“whom the gods love, dies young ” ; but to be loved 01 the gods did
not always imply suc'h a iate. Otherwise, Antipho, when felicitated
by Geta, ab dis solas deligere, Aritipho (Pharsalici), wouldhave
received a doubtful complinreut. The fitness 01 proverbe depende on
the point of view of the speaker. ‘⁶ llappy is the wooing that's not
long a-doing'’ is in a sense contradictory 01 *110111 in haste and
repent at leisurc.'’
