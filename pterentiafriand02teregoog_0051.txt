an Andrian citizen, Crito, a cousin of Chrysis, who is
familiar vvith the early history of Glycerium, and leeds
Chremes to recognize in her his long-lost daughter Pasibula
Thus are removed all objections to her marriage with Parn-
philus, who, together with Davus, is restored to Simo’s
favor.

³4. It will thus be seen that the plot of the Andria is
somewhat intricate. The prineipal cause of trouble lies in
ignorance as to the parentage of Glycerium, and there is much
dramatic irony in the attitude which her father and Simo ⁸
assume toward her before her identity is discovered. Decep
tion, erich source of complication, plays a large part in the
action. Pamphilus deceives his father first by carrying on a
secret intrigue, and later by professing a willing obedience
to his wishes. Simo deceives his son by pretending that
a marriage is arranged, when it has really been broken off,
and Davus is driven to his wit’s end in inventing schemes ,
for deceiving Simo and Chremes. The entanglement which
results from the crossing of these several threads is easily
set right, when the fundamental error is corrected, and it
is discovered that Glycerium stands on the same social and
family footing as Philumena.

3⁵. In the course of the development of this plot, there
are many minor features, worthy of special study, to which
attention is called in the notes. The main underplot found
in the Andria, the love of Charinus for Philumena, is appar·
ently original with Terence. Donatus, in speaking of Chari-
nus and his slave Byrria, at the opening of the second act,
says: hue personne Terentius addidit schalae, narn non sunt
apud Menandrum. This is interesting, showing, as it does,
that Terence felt himself at liberty to enlarge the original
plot by adding not merely soenes from other plays, but also
characters of his own creation. Tbough Charinus is not
essential to the Andria, yet he appears in no less than six
scenes, and Byrria in two. Donatus thinks that the reason
