producing some of the idiomatis features which he finds in
the language of his originals. He imperta bodily Greek
words and phrases, aud almost outdoes Aristophanes in
coining extravagant patronymica and other derivatives, as
well as grotesque mouth-filling compounds to which the
Greek readily lends itself. .

But assuming that Terence, dimidiatas Menander,¹ mirrors
most faithfully the tone and erasemble effect 01 the New
Comedy, we cannot suppose, in view of the great difference
which the most superficiei reader must deteot between him
and Plautus that the earlier writer strictly confined himself
to any one field. We must, indeed, believe that in the
Plautiae plays the author made use ο1 311 the dramatis
resources within his reach. His literary activity began
toward the end, 01 the second Punic war, and it was shortly
after 211 ae, as we have seen,² that the Atellanae were
introduced into Rome. It is highly probable thet these popu·
lar performances suggested to Plautus much of the broad
farce and audacicus roguery which fill his plays. Horace,
who was no admirer 01 Plautus, calls him 3 very Dossennus,

Quantus sit Dossennus edacibus in parasitis (Epist. 2. l. 173),

and the nomen itself 01 the author is plausibly derived from
another stockcharacter in the Atellan 13100, 113. Maccus, the
buffoon. The careless haste which Horace criticises in the
same passage —

Quam non adstricto percurrat pulpita socco—

is probably due quite as much to the influence ο1 inartistic
popular entertainments as to the sordid motive which
Horace imputes 10 Plautus,—

Gestit enim nummum 10 loculos demittere.

The verb percurrere, which Horace applies 10 such a depre-
ciative way to Plautus, is curiously similar in meaning to
